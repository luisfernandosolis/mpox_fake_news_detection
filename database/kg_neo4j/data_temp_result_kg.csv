                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert because of the epidemic, which has increased to more than 134,000 cases, the government said this week.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the chance of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barboza told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert because of the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barboza told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert because of the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the U.S., up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it will treat more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert due to the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it will treat more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barboza told a news conference on Thursday.

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert because of the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert because of the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the U.S., up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it will treat more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert due to the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it treated more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the chance of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert due to the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it treated more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the chance of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert due to the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it will treat more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barboza told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert because of the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the U.S., up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it will treat more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert due to the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”
        

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it treated more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.
        

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the chance of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the chance of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it treated more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.

                 —



          According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), dengue cases are on the rise in the United States, with cases reaching 5.2 million this week, surpassing the annual record set in 2023.
        

          As of Wednesday, 5,214,480 dengue cases had been reported in the United States, PAHO spokeswoman Ashley Baldwin told CNN on Thursday.  In 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
        

          “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa told a news conference on Thursday.
        

          Countries in the southern hemisphere have been hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for the majority of cases.  In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a public health emergency Amid the surge in cases.
        

          In Peru, 20 of the country's 25 regions are on health alert due to the epidemic, which has increased to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.  146 people died.
        

          The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the Northern Hemisphere, should prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
        

          “Most cases in the Southern Hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the Northern Hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said.  “So far this year, we've seen cases peak in the south, and now we expect cases to increase in the north.”

          PAHO says several factors may be contributing to the rise in dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth and inadequate water and sanitation services that create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
        

          So far in 2024, 1,858 people have died from the disease in the United States, up from last year's total of 2,418.
        

          Barbosa said a vaccine for dengue exists and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, but he cautioned that it won't immediately stop the outbreak.

          Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and is also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in severe cases.
        

          In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima Hospital Sergio Bernals, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year.  In 2023, it will treat more than 900 people, Dr. Oscar Torre, head of the hospital's internal medicine department, told CNN en Español.
        

          Patients at the facility are being treated in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many are resting on beds surrounded by netting to keep out mosquitoes that can carry the disease-causing virus, a video from CNN en Español showed.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

          To try to contain the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito that transmits the virus and medical management, Baldwin said.
        

          “Although there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (any clinical condition), most cases are mild. Early detection and proper medical treatment can reduce the probability of dying from severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
        

          According to the World Health Organization, the virus is present in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.  It also occurs in the American territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

The most credible news source in Barbados

(CNN) — Dengue cases are surging in the Americas, with cases reported topping 5.2 million as of this week, surpassing a yearly record set in 2023, according to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO).
PAHO spokesperson Ashley Baldwin told CNN Thursday that 5,214,480 cases of dengue have been reported in the Americas as of Wednesday. 
In all of 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
“We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO Director Jarbas Barbosa said in a news briefing Thursday.
Countries in the southern hemisphere have been the hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for a majority of the cases. 
In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a state of public health emergency amid a spike in cases.
In Peru, 20 of the country’s 25 regions are under a health alert due to the epidemic, which has surged to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week.
146 people have died.
The situation appears to have stabilised in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the northern hemisphere, must prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
“Most cases in the southern hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the northern hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said. 
“So far, this year, we have seen cases peak in the south, and we would now expect an increase in cases in the north.”
The rise of dengue can be attributed to several factors, PAHO says, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth, and inadequate water and sanitation services, which can create mosquito breeding sites.
So far in 2024, the Americas have reported 1,858 deaths from the illness, less than last year’s total of 2,418.
A vaccine for dengue is available and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, Barbosa said, but he warned it is not capable of immediately interrupting outbreaks.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in extreme cases.
In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima’s Hospital Sergio Bernales, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year. 
In 2023, it treated just over 900, according to Dr. Óscar Torre, head of the hospital’s internal medicine department, speaking to CNN en Español.
Patients in the facility are receiving care in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many are resting in beds surrounded by netting to keep away mosquitoes, which can carry the virus that causes the illness, video from CNN en Español showed.
To try to control the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito vector that transmits the virus and clinical management, Baldwin said.
“While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (at any clinical stage), most cases are mild. Early detection and access to proper medical care will reduce the probability of dying due to severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
The virus is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organisation. 
It’s also endemic in the US territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

https://latinamericanpost.com/economy-en/brazils-lula-pledges-fiscal-discipline-amid-economic-uncertainty/,"Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has ordered his economic team to adhere to the country’s fiscal framework, approving significant spending cuts to ensure fiscal responsibility. This move comes amid market concerns over fiscal deterioration and economic stability.
Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ordered his economic team on Wednesday to comply with the country’s fiscal framework, approving suggestions for spending cuts, the country’s finance minister told journalists.
Brazilian assets had suffered a sell-off in recent weeks as markets feared fiscal deterioration amid a government reluctance to cut spending. Investors were concerned about the government’s ability to comply with the fiscal framework approved last year. However, the Brazilian real rose nearly 2% against the U.S. dollar in spot trading on Wednesday as market participants awaited details from Lula’s meeting with his economic team and after the president reaffirmed his commitment to fiscal responsibility.
“The first thing the president ordered us to do was ‘comply with the fiscal framework,'” Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told journalists in Brasilia after the meeting, referring to a constitutional law that limits government spending and ensures fiscal responsibility. This framework is crucial for maintaining economic stability and investor confidence in Brazil’s financial markets. It sets clear guidelines for government spending, ensuring that it remains within sustainable limits and does not lead to fiscal deficits, which can undermine economic stability and investor confidence.
Haddad also said that Lula approved suggestions presented in the meeting to cut 25.9 billion reais ($4.7 billion) in government spending. These measures would allow Lula’s administration to comply with the fiscal framework next year. The government will implement greater scrutiny among the proposed measures to cut social benefits from ineligible recipients. Some of these moves could be accelerated if needed to help the government meet the fiscal rule this year.
The recent sell-off in Brazilian assets has been attributed to prolonged high interest rates in the U.S. and domestic fiscal uncertainties. These high interest rates in the U.S. have led to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making it more expensive for Brazilian businesses and the government to service their dollar-denominated debts. This, coupled with domestic fiscal uncertainties, has led to a weakening of the Brazilian real, which has declined around 13% against the U.S. dollar this year and 6% in June alone. This decline has been exacerbated by Lula’s persistent criticisms of the central bank and its reluctance to cut spending.
Before the meeting, Haddad attributed part of the real’s strength on Wednesday to improved communication from the government. Acknowledging the importance of clear and consistent messaging to the markets is a positive step towards restoring confidence in Brazil’s economic policies.
Brazil’s economic challenges are common in Latin America. The region has been grappling with financial instability, high inflation, and fiscal deficits, exacerbated by the global economic slowdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries like Argentina, Colombia, and Peru are also facing significant financial pressures, highlighting the region’s broader context of fiscal challenges.
Lula’s unwavering commitment to fiscal responsibility is a pivotal step for Brazil, a country often viewed as a regional economic leader. By adhering to the budgetary framework, Brazil is not just setting a positive example for other Latin American countries grappling with similar issues, but also instilling a sense of confidence in its own economic future. The success of these measures in stabilizing Brazil’s economy could potentially inspire similar approaches in neighboring countries, further strengthening the region’s economic stability.
Haddad mentioned that the government could block planned spending depending on the development of public accounts. Later this month, a bi-monthly revenue and expenditures report will be released, which will provide further insights into the government’s fiscal strategy and its impact on economic stability.
The approval of spending cuts is a significant move towards ensuring Brazil’s fiscal discipline. However, the real test will be in the implementation and effectiveness of these measures in addressing the underlying economic challenges. The government’s ability to balance fiscal responsibility with social welfare programs will be crucial in maintaining public support and achieving long-term financial stability.
Lula’s administration is facing a delicate balancing act. On one hand, there is a pressing need to maintain fiscal discipline and investor confidence. On the other hand, there is a significant demand for social spending to address the population’s needs, particularly in the wake of the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. The approved spending cuts, including the scrutiny of social benefits, indicate a focused approach to eliminate inefficiencies while safeguarding essential services, a balancing act that the audience can empathize with.
Brazil’s commitment to fiscal discipline under President Lula da Silva’s leadership is a positive step towards economic stability. The approved spending cuts and adherence to the budgetary framework demonstrate the government’s resolve to address market concerns and ensure fiscal responsibility. However, implementing these measures will be critical in determining their success.
As Brazil navigates these economic challenges, the outcomes will have profound implications for Latin America. The region is closely watching Brazil’s efforts to stabilize its economy and restore investor confidence. The potential success of these measures could serve as a beacon of hope for other Latin American countries facing similar fiscal pressures, offering a model for sustainable economic growth and stability.

While the path ahead is fraught with challenges, Brazil’s focus on fiscal discipline and economic stability provides a hopeful outlook for the country’s financial future. The commitment to adhering to the budgetary framework and the approved spending cuts are steps in the right direction, aiming to restore confidence and promote sustainable economic growth in Brazil and the broader Latin American region.

The Supreme Court has ordered several investigations into Bolsonaro and his aides (File)
Rio De Janeiro: 
Brazilians took to the streets around the country Saturday, once again calling for the ouster of unpopular President Jair Bolsonaro.
Large crowds were expected in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Brasilia and more than 160 other towns and cities as part of the “Bolsonaro Out National Campaign,” which is backed by a dozen left-wing political parties and labor groups.
Among other issues, the right-wing president has come under stinging criticism for his handling of the pandemic, which has claimed nearly 600,000 lives.
Hundreds of people marched through the central Rio de Janeiro neighborhood of Candelaria, shouting “Bolsonaro out!” which was also emblazoned on several large banners.
“We’re going to get him out. The hope of the people here in the streets is to put pressure on legislators so that they call for impeachment,” 69-year-old retired professor Elizabeth Simoes told AFP.
More than 100 requests for the impeachment of Bolsonaro have been filed with the Chamber of Deputies, but its leader Arthur Lira, a government ally, has refused to take any of them up.
The Supreme Court has ordered several investigations into Bolsonaro and his aides, including for spreading false information.
Red flags of the Worker’s Party of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, or Lula, could be seen Saturday, along with Brazilian flags and the signs of several other left-wing and centrist parties often seen at protests against the far-right Bolsonaro.
But backers of the president have also made themselves known in recent weeks, as around 125,000 of them gathered in Brasilia and Sao Paulo September 7 in a show of support for Bolsonaro.
A mid-September opinion poll by the Datafolha Institute found that Bolsonaro has 26 percent support compared with Lula’s 44 percent, just on year ahead of the presidential vote.

https://quicknews-africa.net/nigeria-records-over-300000-tb-cases-in-2023-says-health-minister/,"BRASILIA, Brazil: Nigeria diagnosed over 300,000 tuberculosis (TB) cases in 2023, marking a historic high, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Prof. Muhammad Ali Pate, announced at the 37th STOP TB Partnership Board Meeting in Brasilia on Tuesday.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that during the meeting, the Stop TB Partnership presented insights into TB perspectives and outlined efforts to secure increased and impactful Global Fund investments in TB.
Nigeria, alongside other nations and civil society board members, shared interventions detailing experiences and perspectives with the Global Fund.
“In 2023, Nigeria diagnosed over 300,000 TB cases for the first time in its history, reducing the missing case gap and positioning the country to achieve its 2025 National Strategic Plan targets,” Pate said.
Pate acknowledged progress made while reiterating the country’s commitment to achieving 100% treatment coverage and increasing TB preventive therapy (TPT) coverage. He highlighted efforts to document strategic initiatives and best practices for addressing case-finding challenges in a high-burden country.
The minister credited partners such as USAID, GFATM, WHO, Stop TB Partnership, CDC, DoD, and civil society organisations for supporting Nigeria’s TB control programme. He also commended frontline workers for their dedication amid emergencies and crises.
“The increase in TB diagnoses is a testament to Nigeria’s commitment to tackling the disease head-on and implementing innovative strategies,” Pate stated.
Despite disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria’s TB programme demonstrated resilience, ensuring the continued provision of TB services.
With ongoing support from partners and stakeholders, Nigeria aims to build upon its achievements and further progress in the fight against TB.
Pate emphasised the need to make TB an issue of social justice and advocated for investment in the healthcare value chain and local manufacturing of diagnostics, therapeutics, and medical equipment.
Nigeria invites all participants to join in disseminating lessons learned and best practices for addressing TB case-finding challenges at a public event scheduled for July 2024.
Tuberculosis, caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affects the lungs but can also impact other body parts. It spreads through the air and can be life-threatening if not properly treated. Symptoms include persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats, with treatment typically involving a combination of antibiotics over several months.

https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2024/02/06/brazil-dengue-fever-alert-ahead-carnival/,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AFP)— Sao Paulo opened an emergency operations centre Tuesday to deal with a surge in dengue fever cases that has hit Brazil and South America just as millions of tourists arrive for carnival celebrations.
Cases of the mosquito-borne disease have also risen sharply in Argentina, where a record 10,000 cases were reported in the first three weeks of the year.
Paraguay has meanwhile declared a health emergency over dengue. It has registered 36 deaths since December, including 12 children, officials there said.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s second-biggest city, after Sao Paulo, also declared a public health emergency Monday, four days ahead of the official opening of its famed carnival.
Authorities announced the opening of 10 dedicated treatment centers to alleviate pressure on Rio’s overwhelmed hospitals.
“It’s a good thing they opened this centre. The hospitals can’t handle the situation alone,” patient Luciana Ferreira told AFP in the working-class Curicica neighbourhood.
The capital, Brasilia, has opened an emergency field hospital.
Brazil registered 345,235 likely cases of dengue in the first five weeks of the year, nearly four times the number registered over the same period last year.
Thirty-one people have died of dengue, according to the Brazilian health ministry, which is still analysing another 234 deaths that may have been caused by the disease.
Sao Paulo is testing a drone that uses larvicide to combat mosquitos in hard-to-reach areas.
Brazil plans to start a public vaccination campaign against dengue this month — though a lack of doses from the vaccine’s maker, Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda, means only children ages 10 to 14 will be targeted.
Brazil’s government says it is studying options to produce a dengue vaccine domestically.
Dengue, which can cause hemorrhagic fever, infects an estimated 100 million to 400 million people yearly, though most cases are mild or asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organization.

https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-rising-dengue-cases-could-play-party-pooper-at-rio-carnival-13700702.html,"After recording 10,000 dengue cases, health officials in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro have declared a public health emergency. This comes just days before the âworldâs largest partyâ â the Carnival â is set to begin, raising concerns among the public
The Rio Carnival, the biggest and brightest celebration on Earth is just two days away â it is to begin on 9 February and run until 17 February. However, this cacophony of colour and the âworldâs biggest partyâ is under threat, a threat of mosquitoes.
Medical authorities of Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro â where the annual carnival is held â have declared a health emergency owing to the rapid rise in dengue fever cases. While officials say the infections wonât derail the Carnival, it has prompted a slew of special measures by the city in hopes of containing the illness.
Whatâs going on in Rio? How bad is the situation? We get you the answers.
Dengue fever in Rio
The city of Rio has seen an explosion of dengue fever since the start of 2024. For the unaware,
dengue
is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is more common in tropical climates. Frequent rains and high temperatures make the famously hot city of Rio susceptible to dengue outbreaks.
According to health officials, Rio has already registered a whopping 10,000 cases so far, compared to 23,000 for the whole of 2023.
And in light of the growing dengue cases and the upcoming Carnival, which will see an additional influx of tourists from around the world, the authorities have taken measures to control the situation.
Rio city hall has announced that 10 treatment centres will be opened for people with dengue. The cityâs health secretary, Daniel Soranz, told the BBC that the aim was to decrease the risk of serious cases and deaths caused by the illness. âEarly treatment makes all the difference,â he was quoted as saying.
Health officials have also urged the residents of Rio to use repellents to avoid mosquito bites. In addition, the mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, has urged that residents remove sources of still water, used by mosquitoes as breeding grounds. âUnlike the COVID-19 pandemic, in which individual citizens couldnât do much more than demand that governments get the vaccine, in the case of dengue much depends on the action of each citizen,â Paes was quoted as telling news agency AP.
The authorities have also initiated a âAgainst Dengue Every Dayâ campaign in which repellents, stickers and bandanas with warnings about the disease will be handed out to audiences at the Sambadrome â the venue of the Rio Carnival.
Additionally, fumigation drives will be carried out in areas recording huge number of cases.
Carnival impact on Brazil
However, some believe that the rise in dengue cases could play spoilsport for the upcoming Rio Carnival. But officials have allayed these fears, saying they were monitoring the situation closely.
For Brazil, the Carnival goes beyond just celebrations. It has a significant impact on the Latin American countryâs economy â hotels see an uptick in occupancy, tourists spend millions in stores, and thousands land temporary jobs as guides, vendors, musicians and performers.
This year, according to the CNC â National Confederation of Trade in Goods, Services and Tourism â the Carnival is expected to inject 9 billion Brazilian real ($1.8 billion or Rs 15,045 crore).
In fact, in 2021 when the Carnival festivities were cancelled on account of COVID, analysts had found that the country lost about $1.5 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs werenât created. CNCâs economist Fabio Bentes had then Anadolu Agency, âThe cancellation had a very negative impact on an industry that, by far, has suffered more from the pandemic,â referring to the services industry.
Brazilâs dengue burden
However, it is not just Rioâs Carnival that is under threat from dengue; the entire country is struggling with a rapid rise of dengue cases.
The country with a population of 213 million has registered 345,235 likely cases of dengue in the first five weeks of the year, nearly four times the number registered over the same period last year. Thirty-one people have died of dengue, according to the Brazilian health ministry. And it is still analysing another 234 deaths that may have been caused by the disease.
Other states such as Acre, Minas Gerais and Goias have also declared public health emergencies owing to dengue cases. In fact, the health secretary of Minas Gerias, Fabio Baccheretti, blamed high temperatures for the quick spread of the viral infection Brazil has been experiencing in recent months.
Brazilâs health minister NÃ­sia Trindade has urged people to keep vigilant and not allow for any water to collect.
Additionally, officials plan to start a new dengue vaccine campaign. Last year, the country became the first in the world to offer a dengue vaccine through the public health system.

Rio de Janeiro has declared a state of emergency amid surging dengue fever cases just as millions of tourists are set to arrive in Brazil for the city's famous carnival.
Meanwhile Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, opened an emergency operations centre on Tuesday to cope with the spreading number of infections.
Cases of the mosquito-borne disease have also risen sharply in Argentina, where a record 10,000 cases were reported in the first three weeks of the year.
Paraguay has meanwhile declared a health emergency over dengue. It has registered 36 deaths since December, including 12 children, officials there said.

Authorities announced the opening of 10 dedicated treatment centre to alleviate pressure on Rio's overwhelmed hospitals.
Authorities also will use 'smoke cars' in regions with the highest incidence of cases, diffusing an insecticide in the air. 
'It's a good thing they opened this centre. The hospitals can't handle the situation alone,' patient Luciana Ferreira told AFP in the working-class Curicica neighborhood.
Since the beginning of 2024, the municipality has registered more than 10,000 dengue cases. That is just under half of the total cases - 23,000 - recorded throughout all of 2023. 
The announcement comes as tourists and revellers are pouring into Rio to take part in street parties and attend the samba schools' flamboyant parades.
Among Rio state's operational plans for Carnival, presented by Gov. Cláudio Castro on Monday, is the 'Against Dengue Every Day' campaign.
That will entail the distribution of repellents, stickers, bandannas and hats with warnings about the disease to audiences at the Sambadrome, where a 15-second notice about the fight against the infection also will be shown.

Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is more common in tropical climates. 
Frequent rains and high temperatures, which accelerate the hatching of mosquito eggs and the development of larvae, make the famously hot city of Rio susceptible to dengue outbreaks.
But the problem is national. The explosion of dengue cases across Brazil has caused at least four states - Acre, Minas Gerais and Goias, in addition to the Federal District - to declare public health emergencies.
The capital, Brasilia, has opened an emergency field hospital.
Thirty-one people have died of dengue, according to the Brazilian health ministry, which is still analysing another 234 deaths that may also have been caused by the disease.

Brazil's government says it is studying options to produce a dengue vaccine domestically.
In March 2023, Brazil approved a vaccine against dengue and became the first country in the world to offer a dengue vaccine through the public health system, according to the health ministry. 
More than 3 million people were due to receive a jab in 2024.
On Monday, the Brazilian air force set up a 60-bed field hospital in the Federal District in Ceilandia that was due to begin treating patients.
'Our objective is to relieve emergency care units in the region, given that today the Federal District accounts for around 20 percent of dengue cases in the country,' air force commander Lt. Brig. Marcelo Kanitz Damascene said in a statement.
Dengue, which can cause hemorrhagic fever, infects an estimated 100 million to 400 million people yearly, though most cases are mild or asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organisation.
Most people who get dengue don't develop symptoms, but if they do these can include high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and a rash, according to the World Health Organisation.

While most get better after a week or so, some develop a severe form and require hospitalization. In such cases, dengue can be fatal.
Climate change, which leads to increased temperatures and high rainfall, is associated with a higher risk of dengue, WHO said in December.
Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes urged 'cariocas' - as the residents of Rio are known - to eliminate sources of still water, used by mosquitoes as breeding grounds.
'Unlike the COVID-19 pandemic, in which individual citizens couldn't do much more than demand that governments get the vaccine, in the case of dengue much depends on the action of each citizen,' Paes said.

https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2024/02/07/shadow-state-in-secret-manoeuvres-bolsonaro-twisted-brazils-spycraft-personal-gain.html,"The shocking use of a parallel intelligence scheme against enemies, opponents, state
The ping of cellphone signals across Brazil popped up on maps as tiny dots catching Supreme Court justices, leading journalists, and leftist politicians in a surveillance dragnet that sucked in the locations of Bolsonaro's rivals as part of a covert spy ring, a Bolsonaro off-the-books intelligence machine tailored to the whims of the then-president of Brazil and his sons and unconstrained by law. Until now.
In January 2024, Brazilian authorities launched investigations into allegations that Jair Bolsonaro as president set up a parallel intelligence structure within the official Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) to serve the interests of the Bolsonaro family instead of the Brazilian state.
The investigations centre around the alleged misuse of a powerful Israeli spy software called FirstMile during Bolsonaro’s presidency.
FirstMile is capable of geo-locating targets based on their cellphones and was ostensibly acquired by ABIN for national security purposes. However, authorities now suspect it was used by Bolsonaro allies to illegally monitor political opponents, journalists, Supreme Court justices, and even former Bolsonaro cabinet members who had fallen out of favor, allegations he denies.
Bolsonaro’s son, Rio de Janeiro councilman Carlos Bolsonaro, is accused of being one of the main beneficiaries and disseminators of the illegally obtained information. Carlos has long been his father’s pit bull on social media, attacking critics and spreading misinformation. Investigators believe Carlos likely received classified information collected by the “Parallel ABIN” to deploy against his father’s political enemies.
The revelations around the misuse of Brazilian intelligence agencies harken back to Brazil’s not so distant authoritarian past. From 1964 to 1985, Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship that spied on and imprisoned dissidents. Bolsonaro, an ex-army captain and outspoken supporter of the former dictatorship, now stands accused of resurrecting its tactics to further his family’s personal gain and political interests.
The investigations into the “Parallel ABIN” apparatus led by Bolsonaro loyalists underscores concerns about the weakening of Brazilian democratic institutions after four years of a far-right presidency. The Bolsonaro family's alleged weaponisation of an intelligence agency designed to protect national security for their own gain also represents a dramatic abuse of power with chilling echoes of autocracy.
Origins of the 'Parallel ABIN' under Bolsonaro
The alleged “Parallel ABIN” structure took its roots soon after Bolsonaro assumed the presidency on January 1, 2019. One of his first moves was to appoint a close personal ally, Alexandre Ramagem, as director of ABIN. The two men had formed a bond when Ramagem secured Bolsonaro's safety as chief of his personal security detail during the 2018 presidential campaign.
Beyond personal loyalty, Ramagem's appointment was unusual given his lack of intelligence experience. The Brazilian Bar Association (OAB) noted that the ABIN role would be Ramagem’s first professional experience since joining the Federal Police as a cadet in 2005. Nevertheless, Bolsonaro made the neophyte the nation’s top spy chief.
Ramagem moved quickly to stock ABIN’s senior ranks with other Bolsonaro loyalists. Several of his appointees were former or current members of Bolsonaro’s security team, also with no intelligence credentials. According to the OAB, ""ABIN was being led by people whose main —if not only— attribute was the personal connection and trust they had from President Bolsonaro and his family.”
Investigators now believe that under Ramagem’s leadership, a covert cell began operating within ABIN to serve the Bolsonaro family’s interests using the state’s advanced surveillance capabilities. In essence, ABIN became an espionage apparatus leveraged for the political gain of Bolsonaro and his sons.
FirstMile: The key to spying on Bolsonaro’s enemies
A key tool that enabled the “Parallel ABIN” to monitor targets was the FirstMile spyware system purchased from an Israeli company called Cognyte. It exploits vulnerabilities in cellphone networks to track the real-time location of nearly any cellphone in Brazil.
Bolsonaro allies within ABIN used FirstMile without any judicial oversight to illegally monitor over 33,000 cellphones during the Bolsonaro presidency, according to Federal Police.

Within ABIN, the FirstMile system was controlled by a tight circle of Ramagem appointees personally loyal to Bolsonaro. According to police, even most high-level ABIN officials were kept in the dark about the use of FirstMile, indicating it was an “off the books” operation.

Investigators are still piecing together the full scope of the targets tracked. But the revelations thus far point to systematic abuse of the technology for the Bolsonaro family's personal interests.

Spying on Bolsonaro’s political opponents

Some of the most alarming suspected uses of FirstMile were to monitor Bolsonaro’s political opponents, particularly those involved in investigating wrongdoing by the Bolsonaro government.

For example, multiple senators on a congressional inquiry into Bolsonaro’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic were tracked, including the chairman Senator Omar Aziz. The highly-critical inquiry concluded Bolsonaro committed nine crimes and recommended he be indicted for charges ranging from charlatanism to crimes against humanity.
The secret spy network is also accused of monitoring Kim Kataguiri, a centre-right congressman who became openly critical of Bolsonaro despite previously aligning with him.

These instances indicate Ramagem’s ABIN used FirstMile as a tool for Bolsonaro to keep tabs on lawmakers who were supposed to be investigating him, a major subversion of Brazil’s system of checks and balances.

Spying on Supreme Court justices

In one alarming plot, ABIN operatives tracked Supreme Court justices’ locations and then fabricated evidence trying to link them to organised crime.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes was named on a fraudulent ABIN report as having supposedly met with members of the PCC criminal gang at a shopping mall based on his cellphone being tracked to the location. Another fake report claimed Justice Gilmar Mendes had ties to drug trafficking operations.
The accusations were completely fabricated by the clandestine ABIN duplicate to damage the reputations of the two justices, who had authorised highly-controversial probes into Bolsonaro and his political supporters for spreading disinformation.
The attempt to smear the justices as criminals shows the extreme lengths the Bolsonaro apparatus was willing to go to undermine the Supreme Court and its oversight of Bolsonaro’s abuses of power. As the supreme interpreters of Brazil’s Constitution, the justices were crucial guardians against Bolsonaro’s authoritarian tendencies.
Spying on journalists
In multiple confirmed cases, journalists reporting critically on the Bolsonaro government were tracked by the ABIN doppelgänger.
Reporter Constança Rezende had her location monitored over a span of months after revealing embarrassing details about Bolsonaro’s past in a book. Rezende was also subjected to online abuse and death threats that she attributes to Bolsonaro’s political network. Other journalists targeted cover politics for Estadao and Valor, two of Brazil’s major newspapers.
In 2022, a report to the Supreme Court substantiated the existence of an “office of hate” evidenced as used solely to orchestrate attacks for the purpose of “ideological, party-political and financial gains.”
For the free press, the spying represented an eerie return to Brazil’s dictatorial past when reporters were routinely monitored and intimidated by the state. The targeted journalists said the surveillance made them think twice about pursuing stories critical of Bolsonaro and reminded them their movements were being watched.
Spying on Bolsonaro’s own cabinet members
Not even Bolsonaro’s own cabinet ministers were immune from the illegal spying operations if they voiced dissent or diverged from Bolsonaro politically.
Former Justice Minister Sergio Moro claims he was monitored by ABIN after resigning in 2020 and accusing Bolsonaro of improper interference in the Federal Police. Moro said his and his wife’s cellphones were repeatedly tracked without their consent.
Ex-cabinet members who turned into vocal Bolsonaro critics after leaving government were also allegedly surveilled, including former Education Minister Abraham Weintraub and former Environment Minister Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz.
For Bolsonaro there was no line between party and state; his own ministers were treated as threats if they challenged him or his family in any way. The surveillance of officials within his own government also demonstrate a Trumplike paranoid preoccupation with loyalty by Bolsonaro.
Carlos Bolsonaro’s central role
While Jair Bolsonaro was the head of state, investigators believe it was his son Carlos who played the most hands-on role in deploying the “Parallel ABIN” as an attack dog against opponents.
As a Rio de Janeiro city councilman, Carlos had no formal role in his father’s administration. Yet the 29-year-old was one of Bolsonaro’s most influential confidants due to his social media savvy, serving as the family’s Internet guru. He took charge of Bolsonaro’s online communications during the 2018 campaign in which memes and fake news played a major part.
Once his father became president, Carlos remained a ubiquitous presence in Brasilia and continued managing Bolsonaro’s social media accounts with virtually unlimited access to the presidential palace. He relished his reputation as his father's ""pit bull"" for his combative style, lashing out at journalists, political rivals, and critics.
According to multiple Brazilian officials, Carlos frequently deployed private information about targets that could only have come from classified government sources.
For example, after a judge ruled against one of Bolsonaro's decrees, Carlos blasted the judge's ruling on Twitter and made reference to his low pass rate on the bar exam, information that is not publicly available.
Carlos called out Randolfe Rodrigues, the deputy chair of the COVID congressional inquiry, for skipping sessions. Carlos somehow knew Rodrigues was abroad despite the travel details never being made public.
In another post, Carlos revealed Governor Joao Doria's arrival time at a private airport before Doria's own press team. These incidents led investigators to believe Carlos was feeding real-time location data from ABIN's systems into his social media attacks.
Carlos was adept at spinning the leaked insights into disinformation campaigns that undermined Bolsonaro's rivals by making them look deceitful. If Lula was traveling in secret to Cuba, it must be for an illicit purpose; if Doria was sneaking into an airport, he must be up to no good.
Investigators suspect a pipeline was established allowing Carlos direct access to ABIN's FirstMile system through Ramagem, his father's loyal intelligence chief. They allege Carlos likely received dossiers of information illegally collected by the secret spy network to utilise in his social media attacks and disinformation campaigns against Bolsonaro critics.
On January 29, 2024, Federal Police raided Carlos' homes in Rio and Brasilia as part of the investigation into the ""Parallel ABIN"". They seized computers and cellphones containing messages that presumably link him to the ABIN spying scheme.
Analysis is ongoing. But police say evidence indicates Carlos was one of the major end-users of the ABIN’s illegally-obtained surveillance intelligence that was packaged into detailed reports on regime opponents. An arrest or indictment of Carlos appears imminent.
A coordinated disinformation strategy
While Carlos weaponised the classified intelligence online, investigators believe his father’s inner circle developed sophisticated information warfare tactics to capitalize on the spying.
They allege the Bolsonaro campaign perfected a coordinated strategy using illicitly obtained private data to deploy targeted disinformation and smear campaigns against opponents.
The alleged modus operandi was to use ABIN’s FirstMile system to identify a target’s cellphone location and then feed that information to a network of pro-Bolsonaro online influencers and media figures. These coordinators then amplified manipulated narratives aimed at discrediting, intimidating, or threatening the target based on their private movements.
For example, if FirstMile detected a hostile journalist or politician met with a leftist labour union leader, that information would be leaked to far-right social media personalities who would accuse them of being radical communist conspirators. The goal was to rile up Bolsonaro’s base into viewing the target as an “enemy of Brazil” in need of combating.
Pro-Bolsonaro websites like Jornal da Cidade Online played a key role in disseminating the smear campaigns built on data illegally gleaned by ABIN.
According to Federal Police, frequently published stories using private information about Bolsonaro opponents only obtainable through ABIN’s FirstMile system turned illegal surveillance into propaganda.
A climate of intimidation
For Bolsonaro’s foes in politics, the media, and civil society, the uncovering of systematic spying on regime critics harkened back to Brazil’s experience under military dictatorship.
Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes argued the surveillance created a ""climate of intimidation"" against opposition voices; the message was that if you challenged Bolsonaro, every aspect of your private life could be weaponised against you.
The alleged monitoring of investigators and judges overseeing probes into Bolsonaro also raised concerns about obstruction of justice. Information illegally obtained by ABIN is alleged to have been deployed to try and stifle inquiries threatening Bolsonaro and his allies.
The climate of paranoia exacerbated Brazil’s already acute political polarisation following the most right-wing presidency since democracy was restored in 1985. Bolsonaro escalated rhetoric casting his own countrymen as enemies whilst embracing authoritarian leaders abroad like Donald Trump and Hungary's Viktor Orban.
For the victims of spying, Bolsonaro perverted the state intelligence apparatus to mirror his own worldview: Opponents were treated as traitors to be crushed rather than fellow citizens with dissenting views.
Fallout
The allegations of a “Parallel ABIN” apparatus spying on Bolsonaro’s perceived enemies triggered major fallout in Brazil.
In July 2022, all 27 ABIN directors submitted their resignations in protest of the agency’s politicisation under Ramagem. Career ABIN officials were appalled by how Bolsonaro loyalists had wholly coopted the agency for illicit ends.
When allegations first surfaced, Ramagem denied any illegal monitoring by ABIN. But incriminating revelations continued piling up from whistleblowers inside the agency.
Brazil’s Attorney General ordered the Federal Police to open an investigation into Ramagem and his collaborators in late 2022. Over 30 search warrants were carried out targeting Ramagem allies implicated in the ABIN scheme, including raids on Ramagem’s residences.
Investigators continue piecing together communications and reports from seized ABIN databases for evidence of patterns of illegal spying. However, obstacles remain given much of the exceptional ABIN activities relied on oral communication, vanishing chat groups, and undocumented orders to avoid leaving a paper trail.
Ramagem and figures linked to the scandal were summoned to testify before the Brazilian Senate’s ABIN oversight committee in December 2022. However, Ramagem refused to answer senators’ questions citing confidentiality.
His silence prompted the committee to issue a report accusing Ramagem of transforming ABIN into an apparatus devoted to Bolsonaro’s personal interests rather than national security. The report also recommended charges against all ABIN officials involved in illegal spying operations.
Before leaving office, Bolsonaro attempted to shield Ramagem and others from scrutiny by classifying ABIN documents related to the case as state secrets for the next 20 years. But the Supreme Court overturned Bolsonaro’s sealing order, agreeing that it aimed to obstruct investigations of wrongdoing.
With Bolsonaro now out of power, the full picture of the alleged parallel spying abuses continues coming into focus. The latest raids targeting Carlos Bolsonaro and new whistleblower revelations suggest more damning evidence is still emerging.
The scandal shows how Bolsonaro and his inner circle were willing to ruthlessly exploit state
institutions for personal gain. It remains perhaps the most egregious example of the authoritarian tendencies that plagued Bolsonaro's chaotic presidency, which often tested the limits of Brazilian democracy.
Bolsonaro’s legacy of politicising Brazil’s institutions
The alleged weaponisation of ABIN to persecute opponents crystallised fears Bolsonaro steadily eroded institutional barriers restraining the executive branch.
Throughout his presidency, Bolsonaro stocked government bodies like ABIN with unqualified loyalists, attacked oversight mechanisms, and urged his base to defy Supreme Court rulings that constrain his power grabs.
The Bolsonaro family also faced persistent nepotism accusations for placing relatives in high-level roles despite minimal qualifications. Beyond Carlos' unofficial advisory position, his brother Eduardo was made chairman of Brazil's foreign relations committee and their father Jair Renan leveraged presidential access to boost his influencer career.
Critics warned the fusion of family, party, and state under Bolsonaro embodied a slide towards patrimonialism, the classic hallmark of Latin American autocracy.
While Brazil's democracy proved resilient to Bolsonaro's authoritarian manoeuvres, the ABIN case exemplified the need for renewed checks on executive power, say officials.
With Bolsonaro now stripped of office, investigators hope indictments of those responsible for corrupting ABIN will help deter future leaders from pursuing political vendettas through state institutions.
The Bolsonaro era revealed dangerous flaws in oversight and showed how fragile bureaucratic norms are without robust legal safeguards. Broader reforms are now sought to depoliticise agencies like ABIN and ensure they serve the Brazilian people rather than any single ruler or party.
Brazil may have turned the page on Bolsonaro, but the damage from years of state capture and ideological warfare will take time to repair, say officials. The tentacles of nepotism and politicisation penetrated deep into Brazilian institutions before being exposed through scandals.
The Bolsonaro family's reaction
The Bolsonaro family has ferociously denied any wrongdoing since the probes became public in early 2023. Jair and Carlos Bolsonaro claim it is a conspiracy invented by Brazil's ""deep state"" and left-wing officials.
When Federal Police first requested the IP addresses used to access ABIN's systems in April 2022, the Bolsonaro government refused to provide them, claiming divulging any information about ABIN was illegal. The IP address data could have revealed early on whether Carlos or others in the president's circle accessed the spy systems.
Bolsonaro has accused the Federal Police of being ""against Brazil"" and threatened to expose supposed dirt on Justice Minister Moro if he testified about ABIN's activities.
For his part, Carlos has remained relatively quiet on social media about the ABIN allegations compared to his normally frequent posts. His lawyer has unsuccessfully tried to annul the Federal Police investigation, claiming procedural irregularities.
Ex-ABIN chief Ramagem denied running a ""parallel"" intelligence operation, claiming he had no knowledge of FirstMile's use and did not appoint inexperienced loyalists. However, critics argue the pattern of nepotistic, questionable appointments on his watch speaks for itself.
Bolsonaro's disregard for institutions
While the full extent the ABIN scandal remains under investigation, the confirmed misuse of state spy technology against rivals feeds into broader concerns about Bolsonaro's disrespect for independent institutions and law enforcement oversight.
The former military captain has a long history of praising Brazil's former military dictatorship and downplaying human rights abuses committed under military rule.
The alleged infiltration of ABIN with Bolsonaro lackeys represents a troubling manifestation of his autocratic instincts to subordinate government institutions.
In his four years as president, Bolsonaro cycled through four Defence Ministers and three Justice Ministers as he sought loyalists for those key posts overseeing law enforcement. Like Trump in the US, he referred to his supporters as the ""my army"" and his election win as a ""cleansing"" of Brazil.
Bolsonaro also stacked the federal police hierarchy with trusted appointees, which led to the high-profile resignation of Justice Minister Sergio Moro in 2020.
The Bolsonaro family's flagrant disregard for the proper role of intelligence agencies is just one example of their broader disregard for the rule of law and separation of powers.
The raids and probes into the ABIN apparatus provide the first real accountability around these transgressions after years of impunity while Bolsonaro was president.
Brazil at a crossroads
The revelations of spying and politicisation of Brazil's intelligence agencies will have long-term implications far beyond the Bolsonaro family's legal troubles. They underscore the fragility of democratic norms that constrain abuses of power only if politicians respect and enforce them.
After a history of repressive military regimes, Brazil transitioned to democracy in 1985 and enjoyed decades of functional institutional stability. But the Bolsonaro era tested the limits of those democratic checks and balances like never before.
Brazil now stands at a crossroads between condoning Bolsonaro-style impunity or reaffirming rule of law. The probes offer an opportunity to reinforce and protect intelligence agencies from future capture by autocratic leaders.
The Supreme Court sanctioned the Federal Police raids on ABIN and Carlos Bolsonaro's properties as part of its constitutional duty to step in when other branches of government overreach. Such assertive action from the court to check political interference in law enforcement represents a reasertion of constitutional checks on power.
At the same time, the fact that a president could co-opt state surveillance tools on such a massive scale without detection raises red flags about oversight.
The challenges of safeguarding Brazilian democracy in the post-Bolsonaro era go beyond reforming any single institution. The deeper question is whether society has developed sufficient antibodies to resist future power grabs by populists who pay lip service to democracy while trampling on its substance.

Sluggish US jobs report clears the way for Federal Reserve to cut interest rates
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hiring by America’s employers picked up a bit in August from July’s tepid pace, and the unemployment rate dipped for the first time since March in a sign that the job market may be cooling but remains sturdy. Employers added a modest 142,000 jobs, up from a scant 89,000 in July. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2% from 4.3% in July, which had been the highest level in nearly three years. Hiring in June and July, though, was revised sharply down. The cooling jobs figures underscore why the Federal Reserve is set to cut its key interest rate when it next meets Sept. 17-18, with inflation falling steadily back to its target of 2%.
Stock market today: Wall Street falls sharply to close its worst week in nearly 18 months
NEW YORK (AP) — Another rout hit Wall Street after an update on the U.S. job market came in weak enough to add to worries about the economy. The S&P 500 fell 1.7% Friday to close its worst week since March 2023. Broadcom, Nvidia and other formerly high-flying tech companies drove the market lower and dragged the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 2.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1%. Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed employers hired fewer workers in August than expected. Despite the drop, the S&P 500 is still hanging within 5% of its record set in July.
Treasury recovers $1.3 billion in unpaid taxes from high-wealth tax dodgers
WASHINGTON (AP) — The IRS has collected $1.3 billion from high-wealth tax dodgers since last fall, the agency says, crediting spending that has ramped up collection enforcement through President Joe Biden's signature climate, health care and tax package signed into law in 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel traveled to Austin, Texas, Friday, to tour an IRS campus and announce the latest milestone in tax collections as Republicans warn of big budget cuts for the IRS if they take over the White House and Congress.
Amazon says in a federal lawsuit that the NLRB's structure is unconstitutional
Amazon is challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in a lawsuit that also accuses the agency of improperly influencing the outcome of a union election at a company warehouse more than two years ago. The complaint, filed Thursday at a federal court in San Antonio, mirrors some legal arguments the tech giant made earlier this year in another legal filing in front of the agency. Other companies, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Trader Joe’s, have also challenged the structure of the agency in pending lawsuits or administrative cases. A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on Amazon’s lawsuit.
Japanese 7-Eleven convenience store chain operator turns down Couche-Tard takeover offer
TOKYO (AP) — The parent company of the Japanese 7-Eleven convenience store chain is turning down a takeover offer from Alimentation Couche-Tard of Canada. In a letter made public Friday, Stephen Dacus, who heads a special committee examining the proposed takeover, said the committee carefully reviewed the offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Seven & i Holdings for $14.86 per share in cash. That calculates to about $38.6 billion, or 5.5 trillion yen at the current exchange rate. He says the company decided unanimously the deal wasn't “in the best interest” of the shareholders and undervalued 7-Eleven. He also cited U.S. regulatory concerns. Couche-Tard did not immediately respond.
Google is blasted by UK watchdog for what it calls anti-competitive behavior through digital ads
LONDON (AP) — Google is being slammed by U.K. regulators who say it’s taking advantage of its dominance in digital advertising to thwart competition in Britain. The new claims Friday ratchet up pressure that the tech giant is facing on both sides of the Atlantic over its “ad tech” business practices. The Competition and Markets Authority said that the U.S. company gives preference to its own services to the detriment of online publishers and advertisers. Google is a major player throughout the digital ad ecosystem, providing services for publishers, tools for advertisers and an exchange where both sides come together to buy and sell ads in real time at auctions. The company disputed the allegations.
Jamaica's female farmers rebuild after Hurricane Beryl through women-led cash voucher program
CROSS KEYS, Jamaica (AP) — More than two months after Hurricane Beryl, the strongest July Atlantic hurricane on record, some farmers in Jamaica are still unable to restore their crops and repair their homes. It's a particular burden on female farmers, who make up one-third of the country's registered farmers and are often heads of household caring for multiple generations. The United Way of Jamaica is helping by distributing cash vouchers for supplies to restore fields, repair roofs and buy books for their children as the school year begins. As storms intensify, the organization knows farmers will soon need help building their hurricane resilience, too.
It's not just Harris and Trump who have a lot at stake in next week's debate. ABC News does, too
NEW YORK (AP) — Everyone knows how much is at stake for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump during Tuesday's presidential debate, the only one they have scheduled during their compressed campaign. It's a big moment for ABC News, the network that's producing the event and supplying moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. For the journalists, it will likely be the biggest audience they ever face. Any triumph or misstep will be magnified. Although he agreed to the debate and its terms, Trump has been relentless in his criticism of ABC News in recent weeks. He said this week that “a lot of people will be watching to see how nasty they are.”
Judge gives US regulators until December to propose penalties for Google's illegal search monopoly
A federal judge on Friday gave the U.S. Justice Department until the end of the year to outline how Google should be punished for illegally monopolizing the internet search market and then prepare to present its case for imposing the penalties next spring. The loose-ended timeline sketched out by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta came during the first court hearing since he branded Google as a ruthless monopolist in a landmark ruling issued last month.
LL Flooring, formerly Lumber Liquidators, is going out of business and closing all of its stores
NEW YORK (AP) — LL Flooring, the hardwood flooring retailer formerly known as Lumber Liquidators, is going out of business. Less than a month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the Virginia-based company says it is now “winding down operations” after failing to find a buyer in recent negotiations with prospective bidders. That means all of its remaining stores will soon close their doors. LL Flooring expected to begin to begin the process this week, with closing sales at hundreds of stores slated to start Friday. The retailer says store closures should be completed over the next 12 weeks, with timing varying by location. Scores of workers are set to lose their jobs.

You aren't likely to lose a job in the US but may find it harder to land one
WASHINGTON (AP) — The American labor market, red-hot for the past few years, has cooled. The job market is now in an unusual place: Jobholders are mostly secure, with layoffs low, historically speaking. Yet the pace of hiring has slowed, and landing a job has become harder. If you have a job, you aren’t likely to lose it. But if you’re looking for one, good luck. Since peaking in March 2022 as the economy accelerated out of the pandemic recession, the number of listed job openings has dropped by more than a third. On Friday, the government will report on whether hiring slowed sharply again in August after a much-weaker-than-expected July job gain.
Trump says he'd create a government efficiency commission led by Elon Musk
PHOENIX (AP) — Former President Donald Trump says he would create a government efficiency commission to audit the entire federal government. Trump said Thursday the idea was suggested by billionaire Elon Musk, who would lead it. The commission is the latest attention-grabbing alliance between Trump and Musk, who leads companies including Tesla and SpaceX and has become an increasingly vocal supporter of Trump’s bid to return to the White House. Trump says the commission would recommend “drastic reforms” and develop a plan to eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months, which he said would save trillions of dollars.
Asian shares trade mixed amid caution ahead of key US employment report
TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares are trading mixed ahead of a highly anticipated U.S. jobs report that’s expected to influence how the U.S. Federal Reserve will move on interest rates. Trading is cautious Friday in Asia amid lingering worries about a possible recession in the U.S. The job market report, set for release later in the day, is key, possibly dictating how big of a cut to interest rates the Federal Reserve will deliver. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed in morning trading, while shares gained in Sydney and Shanghai and slipped in South Korea. Trading was halted in Hong Kong because of an approaching typhoon. On Wall Street, most stocks fell.

Trump suggests tariffs can help solve rising child care costs in a major economic speech
NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump is suggesting his plans to increase tariffs on foreign imports will solve seemingly unrelated challenges such as the rising cost of child care. Trump was asked Thursday about his plans to drive down costs of child care preventing women from rejoining the workforce. The GOP presidential nominee was speaking to a group of executives and industry leaders on how he plans to increase tariffs, slash regulations and cut government spending and corporate taxes. Trump has embraced tariffs as a means to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs.
It's not just Harris and Trump who have a lot at stake in next week's debate. ABC News does, too
NEW YORK (AP) — Everyone knows how much is at stake for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump during Tuesday's presidential debate, the only one they have scheduled during their compressed campaign. It's a big moment for ABC News, the network that's producing the event and supplying moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. For the journalists, it will likely be the biggest audience they ever face. Any triumph or misstep will be magnified. Although he agreed to the debate and its terms, Trump has been relentless in his criticism of ABC News in recent weeks. He said this week that “a lot of people will be watching to see how nasty they are.”
Biden says rural electrification and internet improvements underscore 'American comeback'
WESTBY, Wisconsin (AP) — President Joe Biden has traveled to rural southwest Wisconsin to champion new investments in electrification and expanded high-speed internet. He proclaimed Thursday that “all these investments mean family farms can stay in the family.” In the town of Westby, Biden announced $7.3 billion in investments for 16 cooperatives that will provide electricity for millions of families in rural areas across 23 states, with the goal of lowering the cost of badly needed electricity connections in hard-to-reach areas. He also talked about how tens of thousands of homes in the state had received high-speed internet access.
How do you know when AI is powerful enough to be dangerous? Regulators try to do the math
How do you know if an artificial intelligence system is so powerful that it poses a security danger and shouldn’t be unleashed without careful oversight? For regulators trying to put guardrails on AI, it’s mostly about the arithmetic. Specifically, an AI model trained on 10 to the 26th floating-point operations must now be reported to the U.S. government and could soon trigger even stricter requirements in California.
Red Lobster says it will soon exit bankruptcy protection after judge approves seafood chain's sale
NEW YORK (AP) — After months of dozens of restaurant closings and headlines about “endless shrimp” woes, Red Lobster says it will soon exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved the casual seafood chain’s reorganization plan, which includes a sale to a lender group led by asset manager Fortress. The green light arrives under four months after Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy protection. That following years of mounting losses and dwindling customers while it struggled to keep up with competitors. Red Lobster is expected to operate about 544 locations across the U.S. and Canada upon emerging from bankruptcy. Under terms of the acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of September, the chain will continue to operate as an independent company.
Judge in Brazil orders slaughterhouses to pay for Amazon reforestation
BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — A court in the Brazilian state of Rondonia has found two beef slaughterhouses guilty of buying cattle out of what is supposed to be a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon, which is illegal. Raising cattle on protected land is a major source of deforestation. The companies Distriboi and Irmãos Gonçalves were convicted to pay compensation for environmental damages.  They can appeal the decision.

Copa and Cogeca have reiterated their concerns over the potential deal
With EU and Mercosur negotiators due to meet on 4-6 September in Brasilia for in-person talks, European agri co-ops are once again voicing their “strong opposition” to an EU-Mercosur trade deal.
The EU and Mercosur (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) reached a political agreement in 2019 but failed to sign a final deal at their December 2023 Mercosur summit. Widespread farmer protests ahead of the EU elections have further delayed negotiations.
Copa and Cogeca, the European voice of farmers and their co-ops, oppose the deal – arguing that it would have adverse effects it would have on its producers and the environment.
“This agreement in principle takes no account of the changes and initiatives that have stemmed from the EU Green Deal or of the changing landscape in which farming operates nowadays, following the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine,” the two apexes said in a statement.
The deal is backed by the majority of EU member states but opposed by some states, including France, Austria and the Netherlands.

Copa and Cogeca say the deal would hurt some of the most sensitive sectors of EU agriculture. It adds that the Mercosur agreement “remains unbalanced in its agricultural chapter, especially affecting the already fragile agricultural sectors such as beef, poultry, rice, sugar, and ethanol”.
The two apexes are concerned about the ability of Mercosur countries to adopt the same on-farm production standards that the EU strives for and imposes on its farmers. 
“Our organisations cannot accept, under any circumstances, that European standards be weakened or that any European producer is penalised in the market for following these standards,” they added. “Hence, we cannot but reiterate our resounding ‘No’ to such a deal.”
Copa and Cogeca concluded by reiterating their concerns over “the cumulative and difficult-to-quantify impacts of all the agreements already signed by the EU” particularly if the EU were to expand further to the East.
Anca focuses on international news – and with French, Spanish and Romanian languages under her belt, this is an important area of growth for the news.
