The announcement by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came after a meeting of the U.N. health agency’s emergency committee. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency on the continent on Tuesday.

We ask a psychologist to break it down.\\n\\nHow many times have you heard someone say “When it comes to such and such…I’m kind of a perfectionist.” Or maybe you know someone who has never said they’re a perfectionist but…all signs point to it. Turns out, “perfectionism” has been steadily rising since the mid-1990s. That’s according to a 2017 study by psychologist Thomas Curran. But what exactly is perfectionism? Can it actually help you achieve a goal? Or is perfectionism purely harmful? Well, Thomas Curran joins us today from the UK where he’s associate professor of Psychology at The London School of Economics and Political Science and author of the book “The Perfection Trap: Embracing the Power of Good Enough.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Top\\n\\nMezcal: the lesser known staple of Oaxacan cuisine\\n\\nListen • 10:40 Mezcal the lesser known staple of Oaxacan cuisine\\n\\nOaxacan cuisine and culture made its way to Los Angeles years ago. And although the community and various restaurants here have popularized aspects of Oaxacan cuisine like mole, the tradition of mezcal has yet to be fully embraced by the city. Ivan Vasquez, chef and owner of the Oaxacan restaurant and mezcalería Madre , aims to change that. Mezcal is a liquor made from agave, but unlike its close counterpart tequila, it's not typically used in cocktails, but enjoyed as its own drink in Oaxaca. Vasquez opened Madre in 2013, with the hopes of representing Oaxaca and the unique culture of mezcal. Now, Madre has the largest selection of mezcal in the United States, and Vasquez hopes to further educate Angelenos about the unique alcohol at a new festival Mezcal Por Siempre. The festival will take place Saturday, September 14, at L.A. River Studios and bring together over 50 visiting mezcal producers from Mexico. Today on AirTalk, Ivan Vasquez joins us today to share some Oaxacan cuisine and teach us about the rich culture of mezcal.\\n\\nFor more information about the upcoming 'Mezcal Por Siempre' event, including a link for tickets, click here.\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Top\\n\\nFilmWeek: ‘Alien: Romulus,’ Close to You,’ ‘Sugarcane,’ and more\\n\\nListen • 30:32 FilmWeek: ‘Alien: Romulus,’ ‘Close to You,’ ‘Sugarcane,’ And More\\n\\nLarry Mantle and LAist film critics Manuel Betancourt and Christy Lemire review this weekend’s new movie releases on streaming and on demand platforms.

The original film brings together a host of references that many Southern California could probably point out. From scenes taking places in areas like Dodgers Stadium, to what is now the San Bernardino Airport, the film has a host of references that locals will get a kick out of seeing on the big screen. Not just that, but it’s fast-paced action sequences and focus on family is why the film has garnered such universal interest.\\n\\nSo LAist thought it’d be great to bring the film to big screen for our most recent FilmWeek screening, this time in partnership with The Frida Cinema in Santa Ana. Following the screening, Larry spoke to film critics Amy Nicholson and Christy Lemire about the film to discuss its significance in our culture. They were also joined the film’s racing consultant, Craig Lieberman, and 2nd unit director Mic Rodgers, to understand all the effort that went into making this movie a high octane blockbuster.\",\n",

       "  'a.abstract': 'The smallpox vaccine effectively induces immunity against mpox virus infection (formerly simian smallpox) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, although patients with lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm3 require booster doses, according to data from a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology.\\n\\nThe data come from the prospective observational study conducted by researchers at the Infection Biology Laboratory of the Department of Medicine and Life Sciences at Pompeu Fabra University and the HIV Unit of the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain. The investigators analyzed T-cell responses induced by vaccination with JYNNEOS.\\n\\nDespite the substantial decrease in the reporting frequency of mpox cases from the global peak in August 2022 (30,894 cases) to 804 monthly cases in the last six months of 2023, mpox continues to circulate, and there is no specific vaccine. The JYNNEOS vaccine, with protective cross-reactivity against orthopoxviruses, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of smallpox and mpox in adults at high risk for infection.\\n\\nDuring the 2022 outbreak in the United States and Europe, vaccine shortages led to the emergency use authorization of a lower intradermal dose. This strategy was aimed at increasing vaccine supply up to fivefold.\\n\\nFurther clinical trials are needed to evaluate responses to JYNNEOS vaccination and compare different administration routes in patients with HIV infection. Protecting this population against mpox is a priority because people with high viral loads or loCD4+ T-lymphocyte counts are especially susceptible to severe disease.\\n\\nVaccination Responses\\n\\nThe study assessed the immune response to the JYNNEOS vaccine in patients with HIV who were receiving antiretroviral therapy as outpatients at the Infectious Diseases Unit of Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had viral loads controlled by antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≤ 500/mm3 (loCD4 group) or ≥ 500/mm3 (hiCD4 group) in blood. Vaccine responses were compared with those of vaccinated controls without the disease. The study included cases that received the standard subcutaneous vaccine (before August 2022) or the emergency dose-saving intradermal vaccine after its approval in August 2022.\\n\\nThe results demonstrated that the intradermal dose-saving vaccination route is preferable to the subcutaneous route and that patients in the loCD4 group may require at least one booster to generate an efficient response of specific T cells for mpox, wrote the authors.\\n\\n\"This study has two relevant points,\" study author Robert Güerri-Fernandez, MD, PhD, head of infectious diseases at the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, told the Medscape Spanish edition. \"In the subgroup of patients with HIV with effective treatment but without an immune response (ie, loCD4), the vaccine response is worse than in people who have recovered immunity or do not have HIV. Therefore, they need a booster dose.\"\\n\\n\"The second point is that the intradermal route with one-fifth of the standard subcutaneous dose has a better immune response than the standard subcutaneous route.\" He added that it was a good strategy to save doses and be able to vaccinate many more people when vaccine shortages occurred.\\n\\n\"A general conclusion cannot be drawn,\" he added. \"It needs to be validated with many more subjects, of course, but in some way, it reinforced our confidence in the strategy of health authorities to promote intradermal vaccination. There we had evidence that the patients we were vaccinating intradermally were responding well.\"\\n\\nIn Spain, although there is no shortage of vaccines today, they continue to be administered intradermally with a fractionated dose equivalent to one fifth of a standard dose, said Güerri-Fernandez.\\n\\nHowever, in his opinion, observations regarding the two administration routes signal a need for further research. The main message should be that for patients with HIV infection who do not have an immune response, the vaccine response is incomplete, and they need booster doses as well as monitoring of the vaccine immune response, said Güerri-Fernandez.\\n\\nMore Studies Required\\n\\nThe research, which prospectively collected data and blood samples from patients with HIV who received the JYNNEOS vaccine, is small and included only 24 patients with HIV infection, with seven hospital workers who also received the vaccine and seven unvaccinated individuals as controls. \"I am one of the control subjects of the study, and intradermal vaccination is not especially pleasant,\" commented Güerri-Fernandez. \"It is a very innervated area, and the moment of introducing the liquid is uncomfortable. But it is perfectly bearable.\"\\n\\nOutpatient HIV-infected patients from the Infectious Diseases Unit of Hospital del Mar on antiretroviral therapy and with undetectable viral loads were grouped according to their CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Those with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≤ 500/mm3 required at least one booster vaccine to exhibit efficient virus-specific T-lymphocyte responses. The magnitude of the T-cell response after this booster correlated directly with the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of those vaccinated.\\n\\nFor Argentine infectious disease specialist Julián García, MD, clinical researcher at the Huésped Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who did not participate in the study, it is always productive to know that T-cell responses develop in patients with HIV infection, with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts > and < 500/mm3, through an intradermal administration route.\\n\\nGarcía emphasized that the most novel aspect is that the JYNNEOS vaccine induces a specific T-cell response in patients with HIV infection that increases with higher CD4+ T-lymphocyte levels. However, he noted that the number of patients was less than 10 in most study groups, and the control group had only intradermal administration, which limits the interpretation of the results. \"It will be necessary to verify this in studies with larger groups with control groups from all routes and with a correlate of protection.\"\\n\\nGarcía referred to this latter point as a significant source of uncertainty. \"The study is fundamentally based on the cellular response, but nowadays, there is no immune correlate of real-life protection.\" He concluded that the study builds knowledge, which is essential for a vaccine that began to be used for mpox and the effectiveness of which is based on estimates.\\n\\nGüerri-Fernandez and Garcia declared no relevant financial conflicts of interest.\\n\\nThis story was translated from the Medscape Spanish edition using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

Debuting as part of POV’s 34th season, the documentary will premiere Monday, October 18, 2021 on PBS at 10 p.m. ET and at pov.org. It will also be available to stream for free at pov.org through December 17, 2021. La Casa de Mama Icha is a co-presentation of POV and Latino Public Broadcasting.\\n\\nAn honorable mention at the Philadelphia Latino Film Festival and an official selection at the Cartagena International Film Festival, La Casa de Mama Icha offers a profound meditation on notions of home and the inescapable pull of one’s motherland. The documentary follows María Dionisia Navarro, otherwise known as Mama Icha, on a physical and spiritual journey that draws on the complexities inherent to many migrant experiences: distance, the loved ones left behind, and the problem of aging in a country that doesn’t feel like your own.\\n\\nAt ninety-three, Mama Icha feels that the end of her life is near. Despite protestations from her family, she spends her days focusing on just one thing: returning to her native village of Mompox in northern Colombia. Mama Icha dreams of passing her final years taking comfort in the landscapes of her youth, walking along the Magdalena River at dusk, surrounded by her relatives and neighbors in the courtyard of the house that she painstakingly had built during her years of absence, with the money she sent from abroad.\\n\\nThirty years prior, Mama Icha had emigrated to the United States to help her daughter with the care of her children, Mama Icha’s grandchildren, and remained ever since. Now, against the best wishes of her family in the U.S. who feel that she’s built an admirable life in Philadelphia complete with Social Security, a community that supports her, and access to important senior resources, \\u200b\\u200bMama Icha boards a plane and flies back to Colombia where she meets her sons, Gustavo and Alberto, who have been in charge of her house while she’s been gone.\\n\\nBut upon returning, the idyllic world of her memories is put up against a harsh reality of deteriorating family relationships and broken expectations. The confrontation is disappointing and forces Mama Icha to consider exactly how much she’s willing to sacrifice for the notion of home that she’s longed for so long.\\n\\n“La Casa de Mama Icha is a declaration of love to one’s own land,” said director Óscar Molina. “In a time of great displacements, of fragmentation of the bonds of belongingness, of the preponderance of certain hegemonic cultural values, Mama Icha’s story reinforces the relevance of a sense of rootedness. She, heroically and with the strength of ancestral thought, faces great obstacles to meet the goal of living her last days and dying in the land of her origin.La casa de Mama Icha also mirrors family conflicts and how difficult they are, especially when elders start depending on the care of others. Altogether, this story invites us to think about the multiple meanings of the experience of ‘home’.”\\n\\n“This is a story of a woman’s dignity and unwillingness to negotiate her values and fulfill her last wish even if she has to leave a comfortable life behind. Mama Icha embodies the dream of many migrants who long to return home. As for many migrants, home is a complex experience and also the point of departure for most of the other experiences that shape our identity. Mama Icha is returning to a house built from a distance and with remittances sent back to Colombia from the United States due to the financial dependency of the income obtained in their host countries. Her story is also of a woman who, even in old age, plans to repair the family fabric that was damaged during her absence. Our invitation to viewers is always to see in Mama Icha’s story a mirror for our own relationships: towards ourselves, our families and our places of origin,” said producer Brenda Steinecke Soto.\\n\\n“In the lines of Mama Icha’s face we see the contours of a lifetime. A life of joy but also struggle, laid bare by the distance between the places she calls home and the efforts it takes to remain rooted in culture and family. This is a beautiful and loving family portrait that will touch any viewer. Don’t miss it!” said Chris White, Executive Producer of POV.\\n\\nShot with intimacy and proximity to its subjects, La Casa de Mama Icha is an observational documentary that portrays the heroic return of María Dionisia Navarro to Colombia after three long decades abroad. It is also an important reconfiguration of the standard immigrant narrative, reversing the direction and chronicling the cross-generational pain that often comes with years of family separation. At the same time, the documentary records the injustices that many elderly people face once they come to depend on others for their own care.\\n\\nBut perhaps more than anything, La Casa de Mama Icha points to the fact that sometimes the idea of “home” is more of a process of homecoming than the return to any one physical place. In this way, Mama Icha’s house becomes a symbol for her ultimate desire, to spend her final years with the knowledge that, in the end, she made her pilgrimage back to her place of origin.',\n",
