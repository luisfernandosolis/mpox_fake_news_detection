People who have had mpox in the past are more likely to have some immunity than others, the WHO explained

Health authorities in the Argentine Patagonian city of Comodoro Rivadavia admitted Wednesday that a suspected case of monkeypox was ruled out after the laboratory results came in.

A man had showed up last week at a local private sanatorium with symptoms compatible with the disease and with a history of recent trips to other cities. Blood samples were sent to the Malbrán Institute in Buenos Aires and the results were negative. Pending the outcome of the Malbrán Institute tests, the patient had been isolated at his home.

In Comodoro, we have no patients infected with this...; there are no cases at the moment, Regional Hospital Associate Director Laura Álvarez told local media. It is important to respect and be cautious about this type of situation, taking into account the sensitivity of the recent Covid; we should not stigmatize, she added while insisting that people with any compatible symptoms who had been in contact with people who had a travel history sought medical help.

Also Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued an advisory recalling, among other topics, that anyone can catch mpox, regardless of their age, gender, sexual orientation, or lifestyle. The United Nations agency also underlined that people with the malady's distinctive symptoms should remain isolated, and listed the following as signs to be on alert for:

• Rash that develops into blisters

• Sore throat

• Fever

• Low energy

• Headache

• Muscle aches

If you experience these symptoms, isolate at home, contact a health worker, and get tested, the WHO noted while explaining that people who have had the disease in the past are more likely to have some immunity than others and would therefore be chosen to be the designated caregiver in case other family member contracted it. However, the WHO recommended that even these people should be doing everything you can to avoid getting re-infected."

“The Health Ministry has provided an action plan to face mpox. As of Saturday, the ministry has reported nine mpox cases so far.

“The ministry has also conducted a briefing on Aug 17 where the Johor Health Department has and will carry out several measures to create public awareness on the disease,” state health and environment committee chairman Ling Tian Soon said.

The World Health Organisation on Aug 14 declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) following a major spike in cases reported by various countries.

Ling, who is also the Yong Peng assemblyman, said among measures taken by the department include strengthening public health screening activities at international entry points and health facilities in Johor.

He said health personnel are being stationed at international checkpoints at Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ), Sultan Abu Bakar Complex CIQ, Senai International Airport and international ferry terminals.

Ling said training and briefing had been given to health personnel on the field for the purpose of early detection, isolation and treatment.

“Body temperature scanning devices are already in place at these international checkpoints to carry out checks on everyone coming in and out of the country.

“Health personnel will carry out observation on each individual, regardless whether they come from countries that have already reported mpox cases, to look for signs if they are unhealthy before carrying out further checks,” he added.

Ling said among the countries that had reported high numbers of mpox cases are the United States, Brazil, Spain, Congo, France, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, Peru and Germany.

He said the Health Department will also be disseminating information on mpox to create public awareness through social media, targeting high-risk groups.

A state-level mpox operation room is on standby if needed to be activated in response to PHEIC and based on the latest instructions from the Health Ministry.

“However, as of now, no mpox cases have been reported in Johor,” Ling said, urging those who show early symptoms of mpox such as chills, exhaustion, fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, and swollen lymph nodes to immediately seek treatment."

His call to action resonates particularly in Latin America, where healthcare disparities and infectious disease outbreaks have long posed significant challenges.

Argentina’s Pope Francis, known for his deep compassion and commitment to the well-being of all people, recently spoke out about the growing threat of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox). During his Sunday Angelus address, the Pope expressed solidarity with the thousands suffering from this infectious disease. He urged governments and private industries to ensure adequate medical care is available to everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. His message resonates strongly, particularly in regions like Latin America, where the intersection of poverty, inequality, and healthcare challenges exacerbates the impact of global health crises.

The Pope’s words are more than just a call for empathy; they are a plea for action. The mpox outbreak, now recognized as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), has already claimed over 21,500 cases and 591 lives in Africa alone since January 1. Yet, this crisis is not confined to one continent. It threatens global public health, requiring a united and coordinated international response.

Latin America’s Healthcare Struggles

The Pope’s call for equitable healthcare rings particularly true in Latin America. The region has long been plagued by healthcare disparities, with millions lacking access to even the most basic medical services. In countries like Venezuela and Haiti, healthcare systems are in a state of near collapse, with shortages of medicines, medical supplies, and trained healthcare professionals. Even in more developed nations like Brazil and Argentina, the public healthcare system struggles to meet the needs of its population, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Latin America bore the brunt of the virus, experiencing some of the highest infection and death rates in the world. The region’s fragile healthcare systems were overwhelmed, leading to a catastrophic loss of life and exposing deep-seated inequalities in access to medical care. The lessons learned from that crisis are still fresh, yet the current mpox outbreak threatens to push these already strained systems to the brink again.

The Need for Solidarity and Shared Responsibility

Pope Francis’ call for solidarity is not just a moral imperative but a practical necessity. The mpox outbreak, like COVID-19, does not respect borders. In an interconnected world, the health of one population is intrinsically linked to the health of others. If we fail to act decisively and equitably, we risk allowing mpox to become another pandemic that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable.

The Pope’s message to governments and private industries to “share technology and treatments” is crucial in this fight. The development and distribution of vaccines and antiviral treatments must be prioritized, focusing on making them accessible to all, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This is not just a matter of charity; it is a matter of global security. As we saw with COVID-19, the unequal distribution of vaccines and treatments prolongs the pandemic and allows the virus to continue spreading and evolving.

With its history of infectious disease outbreaks, Latin America knows all too well the consequences of delayed or inadequate responses. The region has faced numerous public health crises over the years, from the Zika virus to dengue fever, often with insufficient international support. The current mpox outbreak presents an opportunity to do things differently and act with the urgency and unity that the situation demands.

Private Sector’s Role

The Pope’s call also challenges the private sector, particularly pharmaceutical companies, to put the public good above profit. This is a radical but necessary demand in a world where a country’s wealth often determines access to life-saving treatments. The pharmaceutical industry wields enormous power in deciding who gets access to the treatments and vaccines that can prevent or mitigate diseases like mpox. In Latin America, where economic disparities are stark, the cost of medicines often puts them out of reach for the most vulnerable populations.

The private sector has a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure that life-saving treatments are accessible to all, not just those who can afford them. This means reducing the price of vaccines and medicines, sharing technology and patents, and working with governments to distribute these resources where they are needed most. It also means investing in the research and development of treatments specifically designed to meet the needs of low- and middle-income countries, where diseases like mpox are more likely to spread unchecked.

The Call to Lead by Example

Latin American countries have a unique opportunity to lead by example in responding to the mpox crisis. Governments in the region must prioritize public health and take decisive action to prevent the spread of the disease. This includes investing in healthcare infrastructure, increasing access to vaccines and treatments, and ensuring the most vulnerable populations are not left behind.

In Argentina, Pope Francis’ homeland, the government is responsible for heeding his call. Argentina has a robust public healthcare system compared to its neighbors, but underfunding and regional disparities in access to care still plague it. By leading in the global response to mpox, Argentina can set a powerful example for the rest of the region and the world.

Brazil, the largest and most populous country in Latin America, also has a critical role to play. The government has a strong tradition of public health initiatives, including its world-renowned HIV/AIDS programs. However, Brazil faces significant challenges, including political instability and a deeply divided society. The government must rise above these challenges and take decisive action to protect its citizens from the growing threat of mpox.

The Moral Imperative: Health as a Human Right

At the heart of Pope Francis’ message is the belief that health is a fundamental human right. This principle is enshrined in international law and is a core tenet of Catholic social teaching. Yet, in practice, access to healthcare is often treated as a privilege reserved for those who can afford it.

The mpox outbreak is a stark reminder of the inequalities in our global healthcare system. The fact that people in some parts of the world are more likely to suffer and die from this disease simply because of where they were born is a grave injustice. It is incumbent upon all of us, as individuals, communities, and nations, to work towards a world where everyone can access the care they need.

With its substantial social justice and human rights tradition, Latin America is well-positioned to lead this fight. The region has a long history of advocating for the rights of the poor and marginalized, and this tradition must guide its response to the mpox crisis. By ensuring that everyone, regardless of their economic status or geographic location, has access to life-saving treatments, Latin America can help to build a more just and equitable world.

Answering the Pope’s Call

Pope Francis has issued a clarion call for action in the face of the global mpox crisis. His words resonate deeply, particularly in Latin America, where the impact of health disparities is felt most acutely. But this is not just a call for governments and industries but for all of us to recognize our shared responsibility in addressing this crisis.

The lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic are still fresh in our minds. We know that inaction, inequality, and a lack of solidarity can have devastating consequences. The mpox outbreak allows us to do things differently and respond with compassion, urgency, and a commitment to justice.

In Latin America, where the fight for health equity has long been a central struggle, this is a moment to lead by example. By answering the Pope’s call, we can ensure that no one is left behind in this global health crisis. Together, we can build a world where health is a right for all, not just a privilege for the few."

Fernando Morales, president of industry body the Argentine Naval League, said that a Liberian-flagged ship set to pick up soy cargo had been ordered to drop anchor in the river while a test on a crew member was carried out.

“A crew member with fever and weakness was taken to a hospital in San Nicolas. There they carried out some tests and they say that in principle it could be mpox,” Morales said, adding that the diagnosis was not yet confirmed.

The World Health Organization last week declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years as a new variant of the virus spread rapidly in Africa. A day later, a case of the clade 1b variant was confirmed in Sweden, the first sign of its spread outside Africa.

Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill. The clade 1b variety has caused concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.

Morales said health authorities were guarding the ship and would examine other members of the crew.

(CNN) — African nations could begin vaccinations against mpox within days, according to the continent’s top public health agency, as a World Health Organization official said the spread of a deadlier strain of the virus could be controlled and “was not the new Covid.”

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is at the epicenter of an mpox outbreak declared a global health emergency last week by WHO, with the deadlier clade Ib strain that is spreading quickly in the country detected in at least four other African nations.

“We didn’t start vaccinations yet. We’ll start in a few days if we are sure that everything is in place. End of next week, vaccines will start to arrive in DRC and other countries,” Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya told a briefing on Tuesday.

The viral disease, formerly known as monkeypox, can spread easily between people and from infected animals through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to WHO. Symptoms include a fever, a painful rash, headache, muscle and back pain, low energy and enlarged lymph nodes.

Around 1,400 mpox infections have been reported across Africa over the past week, bringing the total number of cases on the continent to nearly 19,000 since the start of the year – up more than 100% on the same period last year, according to the Africa CDC. The latest outbreak has killed more than 500 people, the agency’s latest available data shows.

That’s prompted a scramble for vaccines as health officials in Africa work with overseas partners to meet a massive shortfall of doses.

“We need to have vaccines,” Kaseya told NPR last week. “Today, we are just talking about almost 200,000 doses (becoming) available. We need at least 10 million doses. The vaccine is so expensive — we can put it around $100 per dose. There are not so many countries in Africa that can afford the cost of this vaccine.”

The European Union and Danish vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic have so far pledged support, the European Commission said last week. Japan and the United States have also offered doses, Reuters reported, citing the DRC’s health minister.

‘Not the new Covid’

WHO’s declaration of a global health emergency is the second time in two years that the United Nations health agency has raised the alarm over the spread of mpox, which for decades had been found largely in central and western Africa.

Mpox is characterized by two genetic clades, I and II. A clade is a broad grouping of viruses that has evolved over decades that has distinct genetic and clinical differences.

Clade II was responsible for a global outbreak that was also declared to be a global health emergency from July 2022 to May 2023. But the new outbreak is driven by clade I, which causes more severe disease. The subtype that’s responsible for most of the ongoing spread, clade Ib, is relatively new.

Last week, the first clade lb case outside Africa was confirmed in Sweden in a patient who had recently traveled to the continent.

But with nations worldwide on high alert for the virus, a WHO official on Tuesday played down fears of a new pandemic as he called for a coordinated response to the outbreak.

“Mpox is not the new Covid,” WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge told a press briefing.

While more research is needed on the clade Ib strain, its spread can be controlled, he said.

“We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether,” Kluge said.

“The need for a coordinated response is now greatest in the African region,” he said. “We can, and must, tackle mpox together – across regions and continents.”

Kluge’s comments came as Argentina placed a cargo ship in quarantine after a crew member showed symptoms of mpox. Meanwhile, the Philippines and Thailand reported cases of mpox in travelers who had been to Africa.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentine authorities have quarantined a cargo ship in the Parana River over a suspected case of mpox onboard, the government said on Tuesday, as global public health authorities remain on alert for a new faster-spreading variant of the virus.

The quarantined Liberian-flagged ship was sailing from Santos, Brazil – also a major commodities hub – to pick up soy cargo, according to the health ministry and industry body the Argentine Naval League.

The World Health Organization (WHO) last week declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years as a new variant of the virus spread rapidly in Africa. A day later, a case of the clade 1b variant was confirmed in Sweden, the first sign of its spread outside Africa.

The ship near Argentina’s inland grains port of Rosario alerted authorities that “one of its crew members of Indian nationality showed cyst-like skin lesions predominantly on the chest and face,” the ministry said in a statement, adding the person had been isolated from the rest of the crew.

The ministry said public health emergency protocol was then activated and the ship, which had been bound for the San Lorenzo port in the Santa Fe province, had to drop anchor in the river.

Only medical personnel will be able to board the ship, while the whole crew will be required to quarantine pending test results, the ministry added.

Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill. The clade 1b strain has caused concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.

Some 13 countries have reported mpox cases caused by other strains across the Americas this year, according to WHO data as of last week. Argentina has previously recorded eight cases, though none were the clade 1b strain.

Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic is set to decide this week on whether to ramp up vaccine production, while Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche has said it is looking to boost its laboratory testing capacity.

A spokesperson for the country’s health ministry told CNN the inspection would be carried out by the border health service, which has already contacted the crew. According to the ship tracking service MarineTraffic, the vessel was anchored on a river off its destination in San Lorenzo as of 6:10 p.m. ET. Its previous stop was in Santos, Brazil.

Medical personnel will board it and inspect whether the crew member’s symptoms are compatible with mpox. If they are, they will take samples for study. The ship will remain in the harbor and the entire crew will be quarantined until the results of the studies are available. So far, the ministry has not said how many people are on board the Liberia-flagged ship named Ina-Lotte.

On Friday, the ministry called for strengthening border health control measures in Argentina, two days after the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to an outbreak of mpox in parts of Africa. Other Latin American countries, such as Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela and Mexico have announced similar surveillance measures.

Quintana Roo is positioned as the second state with the highest number of confirmed cases of monkeypox in Mexico, with a total of eight cases until August 10, 2024, one more compared to week 31, according to the latest report from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (Sinave).

According to the most recent epidemiological report of week 32, from the Ministry of Health, Mexico has registered 53 confirmed cases of monkeypox (Mpox) until August 10, 2024. The vast majority of these cases, 51 in total, have occurred in men.

The entities with the highest number of infections are Mexico City, with 32 cases; Quintana Roo, with eight cases; and Jalisco, with three cases.

During July 2024, Sinave documented an increase of seven cases, going from 42 to 49 confirmed patients. By August 10, the number of cases had increased to 53.

Distribution of confirmed cases by state

As of August 5, 2024, the distribution of confirmed cases of monkeypox in Mexico is as follows:

1- Mexico City: 32 cases (three new confirmed cases)

2- Quintana Roo: 8 cases (one new confirmed case)

3- Jalisco: 3 cases

4- Morelos: 2 cases

5- Puebla: 2 cases

6- State of Mexico: 1 case

7- Nuevo León: 1 case

8- Sinaloa: 1 case

9- Tlaxcala: 1 case

10- Veracruz: 1 case

11- Tamaulipas: 1 case

Comparison and health response in other years

In comparison, during the same period in 2023, there were 285 cases of monkeypox in Mexico. At the global level, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a health emergency on August 14, 2024, due to a significant increase in cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries.

This declaration follows a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) that was issued in July 2022 and concluded in May 2023.

In response to the global health emergency, the National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) issued an epidemiological notice on August 14, 2024. This notice establishes the actions that medical personnel in health units must follow to identify and report probable cases of monkeypox, with the aim of interrupting the chains of contagion and providing timely medical care.

Recommendations against Mpox

Among the recommendations for the population, the Ministry of Health suggests:

– Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol gel solution.

– Wear a medical mask in public places. – Avoid sharing food, drinks, cutlery, and plates.

– Clean and disinfect areas that have been occupied by a sick person.

– Cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing using the inside of your elbow.

These measures are crucial to limit the spread of the virus and protect public health in Mexico.

“We didn’t start vaccinations yet. We’ll start in a few days if we are sure that everything is in place. End of next week, vaccines will start to arrive in DRC and other countries,” Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya told a briefing on Tuesday.

The viral disease, formerly known as monkeypox, can spread easily between people and from infected animals through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to WHO. Symptoms include a fever, a painful rash, headache, muscle and back pain, low energy and enlarged lymph nodes.

Around 1,400 mpox infections have been reported across Africa over the past week, bringing the total number of cases on the continent to nearly 19,000 since the start of the year – up more than 100% on the same period last year, according to the Africa CDC. The latest outbreak has killed more than 500 people, the agency’s latest available data shows.

That’s prompted a scramble for vaccines as health officials in Africa work with overseas partners to meet a massive shortfall of doses.

“We need to have vaccines,” Kaseya told NPR last week. “Today, we are just talking about almost 200,000 doses (becoming) available. We need at least 10 million doses. The vaccine is so expensive — we can put it around $100 per dose. There are not so many countries in Africa that can afford the cost of this vaccine.”

The European Union and Danish vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic have so far pledged support, the European Commission said last week. Japan and the United States have also offered doses, Reuters reported, citing the DRC’s health minister.

‘Not the new Covid’

WHO’s declaration of a global health emergency is the second time in two years that the United Nations health agency has raised the alarm over the spread of mpox, which for decades had been found largely in central and western Africa.

Mpox is characterized by two genetic clades, I and II. A clade is a broad grouping of viruses that has evolved over decades that has distinct genetic and clinical differences.

Clade II was responsible for a global outbreak that was also declared to be a global health emergency from July 2022 to May 2023. But the new outbreak is driven by clade I, which causes more severe disease. The subtype that’s responsible for most of the ongoing spread, clade Ib, is relatively new.

Last week, the first clade lb case outside Africa was confirmed in Sweden in a patient who had recently traveled to the continent.

But with nations worldwide on high alert for the virus, a WHO official on Tuesday played down fears of a new pandemic as he called for a coordinated response to the outbreak.

“Mpox is not the new Covid,” WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge told a press briefing.

While more research is needed on the clade Ib strain, its spread can be controlled, he said.

“We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether,” Kluge said.

“The need for a coordinated response is now greatest in the African region,” he said. “We can, and must, tackle mpox together – across regions and continents.”

Kluge’s comments came as the Philippines and Thailand reported cases of mpox in travelers who had been to Africa. Meanwhile, Argentina’s health ministry said Wednesday that tests carried out on a crew member of a cargo ship that was placed in quarantine were negative for mpox.

he Liberian-flagged INA-LOTTE was isolated pending a decision from sanitary border experts

A Liberian-flagged cereal freighter was isolated off the Argentine port of San Lorenzo, north of Rosario on the Parana River, after a crewmember was reported to have monkeypox symptoms. The vessel stemmed from Spain.

The sanitary protocol was activated and the Border Health Staff was summoned. The Security Ministry agency isolated those members of the INA-LOTTE ship with symptoms compatible with the malady declared last week by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)

The presence of the suspected infected person on board was reported to the authorities by the ship's captain, who spoke about a crewmember suffering from severe malaise and requiring medical assistance.

As per the WHO's indications, only authorized health personnel may board the ship and no one may get off until the status of persons with suspected symptoms has been determined.

In addition, two people in Rosario -a man and a woman- were confirmed to have mpox. The man had a recent travel history to Spain, it was also explained. Local infectiologist Carolina Subirá said in a TV interview that the man's case was in no way connected to the INA-LOTTE. The patient is 34 years old and is a traveler who returned last Aug. 10 and had symptoms 48 hours before. But after several tests, his diagnosis was confirmed on Tuesday, the Santa Fe provincial Health Ministry said in a statement. Regarding the 38-year-old woman, she had no travel record and doctors are yet baffled as to how she contracted the disease.

Monkeypox is a sylvatic viral zoonosis caused by a virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus and is commonly found in tropical rainforest-rich central and western Africa. The disease can be transmitted by exposure to exhaled droplets (respiratory) and by contact with infected skin lesions (including sexual intercourse) or contaminated materials. The incubation period can range from 5 to 21 days, while the most common symptoms are fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion, which are also accompanied by a rash. The rash often starts on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body, including the genitals: lesions may be very itchy or painful.

Authorities also advised the population to self-isolate in case of symptoms compatible with the disease, wear a facemask, stay at a distance from other people, seek professional help, and not self-medicate."

And while agencies worldwide are tracking the spread of the pestilence, one facet of this PHEIC mirrors COVID-19, the one before it: bushmeat.

While the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was identified as the epicentre site of the COVID-19 pandemic, bushmeat has been implicated since the 1970s in mpox. That is when the disease became first known to science.

“Notable zoonotic diseases such as EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) and mpox have established origins from Central Africa in the 1970s and are believed to have been transmitted through bushmeat…,” a paper published last year and titled Mapping Global Bushmeat Activities to Improve Zoonotic Spillover Surveillance by Using Geospatial Modeling, had noted.

The WHO too recognises this. “MPXV (mpox virus) transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat,” it notes on its website.

But bushmeat in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be just wished away. For one, it provides food security to the region. It is also a cultural practice. How can zoonotic spillover be prevented then?

What is bushmeat?

The paper defines bushmeat as “the meat of terrestrial wild mammals hunted primarily for human consumption in tropical and subtropical regions”.

While terrestrial wild mammals make up just 1.8 per cent of the global biomass of mammals, over 70 per cent of zoonotic disease spillover events have been associated with wildlife and bushmeat, according to the paper.

“Hunting, preparing, and selling bushmeat (hereafter referred to as bushmeat activities) has been associated with high risk for zoonotic pathogen spillover due to contact with infectious materials from animals… For instance, Ebola virus spillover events and subsequent outbreaks in the Congo Basin have been traced back to hunters who were exposed to ape carcasses,” it noted.

Importance in Africa

The paper’s authors mapped bushmeat activities in tropical and subtropical rural areas. Their results were startling but not unexpected.

They found that the largest areas associated with bushmeat activities worldwide were in Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and West Africa.

The top 10 countries were Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Laos, Uganda, Vietnam, Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon.

The country of Equatorial Guinea in Central Africa (which consists of Rio Muni on the African mainland and the island of Bioko) had the highest proportion of land area associated with bushmeat activities.

“Equatorial Guinea is also home to the largest bushmeat market in Africa, Malabo Market on Bioko Island, where recent efforts to limit bushmeat sales through bans have been largely ineffective,” the study noted.

According to the researchers, most countries of Central Africa have a negligible (like Gabon or the Democratic Republic of Congo or DRC) or limited (Cameroon and Central African Republic) domestic livestock sector. This is the reason why bushmeat is a crucial component of food security.

And the demand is increasing as Africa’s population rises. “Every year, five to six million tons of wild meat are harvested in Central Africa to respond to increasing demand,” noted the Wildlife Conservation Society last year.

The authors of a 2019 paper titled From the Forest to the Dish: A Comprehensive Study of the Wildmeat Value Chain in Yangambi, Democratic Republic of Congo, profiled the town of Yangambi near the key eastern city of Kisangani in terms of the bushmeat trade.

They found that the most traded species in Yangambi were small monkeys (38 per cent of the biomass) and red duikers (31 per cent), blue duikers, bush pigs, and bush tailed porcupines.

“Because zoonotic diseases known to be transmitted from wild mammals, such as mpox and Ebola, continue to emerge and expand geographically, an urgent need exists to integrate bushmeat activities into the epidemiology of emerging zoonoses,” the authors of the 2023 paper noted.

They used uncertainty levels on the map to identify 100 urban locations that could most benefit from future bushmeat surveillance efforts. The largest numbers were in Brazil, followed by DRC and Colombia.

Preventing spillover

The authors of both papers agreed that neither banning bushmeat nor behaviour change campaigns would make a difference.

The 2023 paper’s authors cited the importance of preventing deforestation.

“Deforestation associated with development of logging roads enables easier access to the deeper forest and provides faster transportation of hunted meat to villages and towns. Control of deforestation and logging is urgently needed and could have far-reaching benefits for preventing bushmeat-associated zoonoses, as already established with EVD,” the paper said.

Tackling climate change could also help as precipitation was a key factor that effected bushmeat activities.

“In most areas, hunting pressure increases during the dry season when the water sources dry up, but in other areas, bushmeat hunting is preferred in periods of increased rainfall because the hunting sites become inaccessible to conservation patrols,” according to the analysis.

The authors of the 2019 paper, on the other hand, advocated for creating alternative sources of food.

“While behavior change campaigns, as suggested by Chaves et al. (2018), might work in some contexts, we believe that patterns of bushmeat consumption in Yangambi will not change until alternative sources of food and income for a growing population can be established. Where the dependency on the resource is so intrinsically linked to people’s basic needs, there are little chances that behavioral change campaigns will have a significant impact,” they wrote."

The Argentine government has advised people to up all prevention measures while announcing tougher border controls

A new case of monkeypox was confirmed Friday in the Argentine province of Corrientes, bringing the total number of cases in the country to six in the same week that the World Health Organization declared the malady a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) after an outbreak in Africa.

The new infection was included in Friday's issue of the federal Health Ministry's National Epidemiological Bulletin (BEN) which collected data from Corrientes' Public Health Minister Ricardo Cardozo, who also explained that the local patient has already been discharged and is progressing well.

Argentina's first case was confirmed in the province of Buenos Aires, followed by two others in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA), one in Santa Fe, and one in Río Negro. With the one in Corrientes, a total of six cases have been confirmed out of 39 reported. The infected patients were aged between 23 and 38 years, it was also explained.

According to Corrientes' Epidemiology Department, the new appearance was not the new variant, but rather a case of the simian smallpox type that has been appearing from time to time since 2022. The new variant is still in Africa, the authorities stressed. In 2024, 548 deaths and 15,664 potential cases of the disease were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Monkeypox is a disease caused by the monkeypox virus. Currently, two different clades, I and II, have been identified.

The main symptoms include vesicular rashes in various areas of the body such as the genitals, perianal region, hands, and torso. Fever and myalgias may also be experienced. So far, there have been no deaths from monkeypox in the country.

However, national health authorities have announced reinforced prevention measures, as well as tighter border controls pursuant to international regulations. The government also encouraged people who have had contact with an affected person to go to a health center and avoid contact with other people until symptoms are alleviated. It has been proven that the way to catch the virus clade I MPXV is through person-to-person transmission, after being in contact with people with typical monkeypox lesions, or the clothing of an infected person."

Listen • 16:47 Latest on mpox as the WHO declares it a global health emergency

The World Health Organization declared Wednesday that the increasing spread of mpox in Africa is a global health emergency, warning the virus might ultimately spill across international borders. The announcement by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came after a meeting of the U.N. health agency’s emergency committee. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency on the continent on Tuesday. WHO said there have been more than 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa this year, which already exceed last year’s figures.

Today on AirTalk, Austin talks to Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, MD , infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at the UCSF Medical Center, about the implications of mpox as a global health emergency and what this’ll mean in tackling the problem.

Listen • 22:07 Is being a perfectionist helpful, harmful, or both? We ask a psychologist to break it down.

How many times have you heard someone say “When it comes to such and such…I’m kind of a perfectionist.” Or maybe you know someone who has never said they’re a perfectionist but…all signs point to it. Turns out, “perfectionism” has been steadily rising since the mid-1990s. That’s according to a 2017 study by psychologist Thomas Curran. But what exactly is perfectionism? Can it actually help you achieve a goal? Or is perfectionism purely harmful? Well, Thomas Curran joins us today from the UK where he’s associate professor of Psychology at The London School of Economics and Political Science and author of the book “The Perfection Trap: Embracing the Power of Good Enough.”

Mezcal: the lesser known staple of Oaxacan cuisine

Listen • 10:40 Mezcal the lesser known staple of Oaxacan cuisine

Oaxacan cuisine and culture made its way to Los Angeles years ago. And although the community and various restaurants here have popularized aspects of Oaxacan cuisine like mole, the tradition of mezcal has yet to be fully embraced by the city. Ivan Vasquez, chef and owner of the Oaxacan restaurant and mezcalería Madre , aims to change that. Mezcal is a liquor made from agave, but unlike its close counterpart tequila, it's not typically used in cocktails, but enjoyed as its own drink in Oaxaca. Vasquez opened Madre in 2013, with the hopes of representing Oaxaca and the unique culture of mezcal. Now, Madre has the largest selection of mezcal in the United States, and Vasquez hopes to further educate Angelenos about the unique alcohol at a new festival Mezcal Por Siempre. The festival will take place Saturday, September 14, at L.A. River Studios and bring together over 50 visiting mezcal producers from Mexico. Today on AirTalk, Ivan Vasquez joins us today to share some Oaxacan cuisine and teach us about the rich culture of mezcal.

FilmWeek presents ‘The Fast and the Furious’: post-screening conversation with special guests

Listen • 19:04 FilmWeek presents ‘The Fast and the Furious’: post-screening conversation with special guests

“I live my life a quarter mile at a time.” In Los Angeles, many drivers can relate to that famous quote from “The Fast and the Furious,” said by character Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel. The original film brings together a host of references that many Southern California could probably point out. From scenes taking places in areas like Dodgers Stadium, to what is now the San Bernardino Airport, the film has a host of references that locals will get a kick out of seeing on the big screen. Not just that, but it’s fast-paced action sequences and focus on family is why the film has garnered such universal interest.

So LAist thought it’d be great to bring the film to big screen for our most recent FilmWeek screening, this time in partnership with The Frida Cinema in Santa Ana. Following the screening, Larry spoke to film critics Amy Nicholson and Christy Lemire about the film to discuss its significance in our culture. They were also joined the film’s racing consultant, Craig Lieberman, and 2nd unit director Mic Rodgers, to understand all the effort that went into making this movie a high octane blockbuster."

WHO made the announcement on Wednesday, following the African Centre for Disease Control declaring a continental health emergency on Wednesday.

The organisations’ emergency committee met to determine the rising case numbers and transmission risks warranted a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC).

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told press the emergency committee had advised him the situation constituted “a public health emergency of international concern”.

“A public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm under international health law,” Mr Adhanom said.

Mpox is an infectious viral disease which spreads from person to person through direct contact, or through contact with animals.

The decision has come amid a troubling surge in mpox cases as 16 of 26 countries with recorded infections reported an increase of cases in June.

Australia experienced the sharpest rise in the Western Pacific Region with cases almost doubling from 33 to 64.

There was also a rise in cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (543 v 459), Spain (54 v 38) and Colombia (11 v 0).

“It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,” said Mr Adhanom.

Globally, there have been 99,176 cases between January and June with 3,491 cases in the Western Pacific region – a fraction of the 62,904 cases in the Americas.

Suspected mpox cases in Africa have surged past 17,000 with at least 13 countries across the continent impacted, according to the African Union's health watchdog.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg when we consider the many weaknesses in surveillance, laboratory testing and contact tracing,” the African Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday.

To combat the crisis, the WHO has rolled out an initial US$15 million regional response plan to improve surveillance, preparedness, and response activities.

Mr Adhanom said the organisation has already released US$1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies and will seek further funding from donors

Mpox is characterized by two genetic clades, I and II. A clade is a broad grouping of viruses that has evolved over decades that has distinct genetic and clinical differences.

The data come from the prospective observational study conducted by researchers at the Infection Biology Laboratory of the Department of Medicine and Life Sciences at Pompeu Fabra University and the HIV Unit of the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain. The investigators analyzed T-cell responses induced by vaccination with JYNNEOS.

Despite the substantial decrease in the reporting frequency of mpox cases from the global peak in August 2022 (30,894 cases) to 804 monthly cases in the last six months of 2023, mpox continues to circulate, and there is no specific vaccine. The JYNNEOS vaccine, with protective cross-reactivity against orthopoxviruses, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of smallpox and mpox in adults at high risk for infection.

During the 2022 outbreak in the United States and Europe, vaccine shortages led to the emergency use authorization of a lower intradermal dose. This strategy was aimed at increasing vaccine supply up to fivefold.

Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate responses to JYNNEOS vaccination and compare different administration routes in patients with HIV infection. Protecting this population against mpox is a priority because people with high viral loads or loCD4+ T-lymphocyte counts are especially susceptible to severe disease.

Vaccination Responses

The study assessed the immune response to the JYNNEOS vaccine in patients with HIV who were receiving antiretroviral therapy as outpatients at the Infectious Diseases Unit of Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had viral loads controlled by antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≤ 500/mm3 (loCD4 group) or ≥ 500/mm3 (hiCD4 group) in blood. Vaccine responses were compared with those of vaccinated controls without the disease. The study included cases that received the standard subcutaneous vaccine (before August 2022) or the emergency dose-saving intradermal vaccine after its approval in August 2022.

The results demonstrated that the intradermal dose-saving vaccination route is preferable to the subcutaneous route and that patients in the loCD4 group may require at least one booster to generate an efficient response of specific T cells for mpox, wrote the authors.

""This study has two relevant points,"" study author Robert Güerri-Fernandez, MD, PhD, head of infectious diseases at the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, told the Medscape Spanish edition. ""In the subgroup of patients with HIV with effective treatment but without an immune response (ie, loCD4), the vaccine response is worse than in people who have recovered immunity or do not have HIV. Therefore, they need a booster dose.""

""The second point is that the intradermal route with one-fifth of the standard subcutaneous dose has a better immune response than the standard subcutaneous route."" He added that it was a good strategy to save doses and be able to vaccinate many more people when vaccine shortages occurred.

""A general conclusion cannot be drawn,"" he added. ""It needs to be validated with many more subjects, of course, but in some way, it reinforced our confidence in the strategy of health authorities to promote intradermal vaccination. There we had evidence that the patients we were vaccinating intradermally were responding well.""

In Spain, although there is no shortage of vaccines today, they continue to be administered intradermally with a fractionated dose equivalent to one fifth of a standard dose, said Güerri-Fernandez.

However, in his opinion, observations regarding the two administration routes signal a need for further research. The main message should be that for patients with HIV infection who do not have an immune response, the vaccine response is incomplete, and they need booster doses as well as monitoring of the vaccine immune response, said Güerri-Fernandez.

More Studies Required

The research, which prospectively collected data and blood samples from patients with HIV who received the JYNNEOS vaccine, is small and included only 24 patients with HIV infection, with seven hospital workers who also received the vaccine and seven unvaccinated individuals as controls. ""I am one of the control subjects of the study, and intradermal vaccination is not especially pleasant,"" commented Güerri-Fernandez. ""It is a very innervated area, and the moment of introducing the liquid is uncomfortable. But it is perfectly bearable.""

Outpatient HIV-infected patients from the Infectious Diseases Unit of Hospital del Mar on antiretroviral therapy and with undetectable viral loads were grouped according to their CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Those with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≤ 500/mm3 required at least one booster vaccine to exhibit efficient virus-specific T-lymphocyte responses. The magnitude of the T-cell response after this booster correlated directly with the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of those vaccinated.

For Argentine infectious disease specialist Julián García, MD, clinical researcher at the Huésped Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who did not participate in the study, it is always productive to know that T-cell responses develop in patients with HIV infection, with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts > and < 500/mm3, through an intradermal administration route.

García emphasized that the most novel aspect is that the JYNNEOS vaccine induces a specific T-cell response in patients with HIV infection that increases with higher CD4+ T-lymphocyte levels. However, he noted that the number of patients was less than 10 in most study groups, and the control group had only intradermal administration, which limits the interpretation of the results. ""It will be necessary to verify this in studies with larger groups with control groups from all routes and with a correlate of protection.""

García referred to this latter point as a significant source of uncertainty. ""The study is fundamentally based on the cellular response, but nowadays, there is no immune correlate of real-life protection."" He concluded that the study builds knowledge, which is essential for a vaccine that began to be used for mpox and the effectiveness of which is based on estimates.

Güerri-Fernandez and Garcia declared no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

A cluster of monkeypox cases has emerged in Chicago just as the World Health Organization (WHO) is declaring the health emergency over.

A dozen confirmed cases and one probable case of monkeypox were reported in the nation’s third-biggest city in the period from April 17 to May 5. In all of these cases, the virus was spread through sexual contact. Nine of the infections were noted in men who were fully vaccinated against the virus.

Although none of the infected individuals were hospitalized, the city is nevertheless warning of a ""resurgence"" of monkeypox. The illness grabbed a lot of headlines last year when it started spreading rapidly among gay and bisexual men in Europe and the U.S.; its rise coincided with gay pride celebrations in many cities. Cases peaked in August before tapering off, largely due to greater awareness. So far, just over 30,000 Americans have been diagnosed with monkeypox.

In the Chicago uptick, officials are worried about the disease spreading undetected among individuals, including those who are vaccinated. The men who are infected have an average age of 34, and a third of them also have HIV. Some of the men involved had recently traveled to places like Mexico, New York City and New Orleans.

Chicago Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Allison Arwady announced that cases have been rising in the Windy City. Speaking on Facebook Live, she said: “Most weeks we didn't see a single mpox case, maybe one or two in a higher week. But just these last couple of weeks we saw two, then five, now another six coming in.”

Officials have been issuing warnings recently about the potential for a resurgence this summer as hundreds of thousands of individuals head to gay pride festivities throughout the nation. So far, however, there has not been an uptick beyond the one in Chicago.

A total of 62 cases were reported in the two-week period from April 26 to May 10, with most of them being in Texas, followed closely by Illinois. Other cases were reported in Louisiana, California, New York, Florida, Oregon and Alabama. However, officials from Texas said that at least 17 of those cases were actually from last year and were only just now being added to the CDC's count.

WHO declares monkeypox health emergency over

The WHO recently declared an end to the international emergency declared over the virus last July, when Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus overruled an expert committee in issuing the designation. Some believe that he may have been acting out of an abundance of caution due to criticism over how the WHO responded to COVID in its early days.

However, he now says that the outbreak is largely under control, declaring: “We now see steady progress in controlling the outbreak based on the lessons of HIV and working closely with the most affected communities.

“I'm pleased to declare that the mpox is no longer a global health emergency,” he added.

Monkeypox, which is now sometimes referred to as “mpox” in an attempt to destigmatize it, has long been present in certain areas of western and central Africa, where individuals are infected by wild animals. However, it was not responsible for major outbreaks until epidemics started popping up around the world last May.

The disease is marked by a telltale rash accompanied by headache, fever, swollen lymph nodes and muscle pain. It can only be spread through close physical contact with someone who is infected, or contact with their bedding or clothing, and it generally responds well to antivirals. However, it can take around a month to recover from the virus.

Despite being relatively mild in most people, it won’t be surprising if officials and pharmaceutical companies use the Chicago uptick and the impending summer gay pride festivals as a reason to try to push vaccines on people.

It’s possible that large outbreaks could once again emerge in the near future, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned.

Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a close cousin to the smallpox virus. Like smallpox, its symptoms typically include flu-like illness and a distinctive rash. Rarely, the infection can lead to severe, life-threatening complications, including pneumonia, brain inflammation, and sepsis.

Until recently, mpox was primarily a zoonotic disease—spreading from animals to humans—that periodically caused outbreaks in parts of Africa. But last year, the virus burst onto the world stage, with outbreaks that spread widely from person to person. As of early May, at least 80,000 cases in over 100 countries have been documented worldwide since the start of 2022, along with 140 deaths (fortunately, the strains that circulated globally belonged to a less lethal lineage of the virus). This has included over 30,000 cases and 42 deaths in the U.S.

The widespread emergence of the virus eventually led the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency of international concern, the first since the covid-19 pandemic. Thankfully, there was already a vaccine developed against mpox prior to 2022, and it’s believed that existing smallpox vaccines would provide significant protection against it as well.

The disease can spread through any kind of direct contact with infectious lesions or other parts of the body. But these recent outbreaks have largely been transmitted through sexual contact, especially among men who have sex with men. Public health awareness and vaccination campaigns targeted to these groups are thought to have helped stem its spread since last summer, when cases in the U.S. and the world reached their peak.

By last winter, new documented U.S. and global cases of mpox had plummeted. In January, the U.S. lifted its public health emergency related to mpox, while the WHO ended its declaration just today. And as of late April 2023, the nationwide average of reported cases in the U.S. had dropped to zero. But there has been an uptick more recently.

Sixty cases have been reported to the CDC in the past two weeks across eight states, CBS News reported Thursday. Some of these might be older cases only now being reported, but there have been genuine new clusters. In a health alert released Wednesday, for instance, the Chicago Department of Public Health announced that it has “identified a resurgence of cases of mpox.”

These newest outbreaks still appear to be spreading primarily among previously identified high risk groups. But, in an alarming development, they’re occurring in vaccinated people as well. Nine of the 13 cases in Chicago so far documented have been in fully vaccinated men. Several of these men had also recently traveled to other places, including New York City and Mexico. Though it’s expected to provide substantial protection against infection, the vaccine isn’t 100% effective, and its protection may wane over time, according to the CDC.

Despite the news, vaccination is still thought to be one of the most effective strategies for containing mpox. Health officials continue to advise people at high risk to get the two-dose vaccine. Even in vaccinated people who catch mpox, the vaccine would likely reduce the odds of severe illness. Higher rates of vaccination coverage in high-risk communities can also limit the potential of the virus to spread widely.

While mpox isn’t thought to have the epidemic potential of diseases like covid-19, health officials have long warned that its threat may not be over yet. In April, a modeling assessment by the CDC estimated a greater than 35% chance of resurgent outbreaks in most parts of the U.S. if nothing changes—outbreaks that could be larger than those seen last year. In these areas, vaccination coverage among high-risk populations still remains relatively low, the CDC noted.

What’s the context? Tight supplies have mostly been snapped up by the United States, but some hard-hit nations such as Brazil and Peru still have none.

United States snaps up most vaccine supplies

Some hard-hit nations yet to receive vaccines

Black, Latino men missing out on U.S. doses By Lucy Middleton Concern is growing that the scramble for scarce supplies of monkeypox vaccines could see some nations and high-risk groups miss out - recalling unequal global access to COVID-19 vaccines and HIV medication. The outbreak, which has reached nearly 100 countries outside of Africa, where the virus is endemic, is overwhelmingly being transmitted among men who have sex with men. They are getting priority for vaccination globally, but some face a longer wait than others. ""In a lot of ways we're seeing history repeat itself, unfortunately,"" said Wafaa El-Sadr, executive vice president for Columbia Global Centers, Columbia University's international network of campuses. ""We have yet to learn the hard lessons we learned first from HIV and COVID-19 more recently,"" she added.

Effective HIV treatments hit the market in 1996 and soon ended the crisis phase of the AIDS epidemic in Western nations, but it was years later before substantial antiretroviral supplies reached sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, COVID-19 vaccines and treatments were stockpiled by the richest countries. Limited supplies of Bavarian Nordic's monkeypox vaccine have mostly been snapped up by the United States - the country with the most cases, but some hard-hit nations such as Brazil and Peru still have none, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. The WHO is trying to set up an equitable distribution mechanism, but has no access to vaccines. U.S. officials said on Aug. 26 that nearly 1.1 million vials of the vaccine - called Jynneos, Imvanex and Imvamune, depending on the country - have either been allocated to jurisdictions within the United States or are now available for ordering. The country is home to more than 18,000 of the roughly 48,800 cases diagnosed in 99 nations during 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This has left other nations to scramble for the remaining doses, even as scientists remain unsure how well the vaccine will work.

Fair distribution? Besides calling for fair distribution among newly hit countries, some experts say an equitable global response would also prioritise high-risk people in the 11 central and western countries in Africa where monkeypox has become endemic since first being identified in humans in 1970. In Africa, however, some health officials see no urgent need to vaccinate against the virus, which spreads through very close contact, and has caused 15 deaths worldwide this year. ""Vaccine hoarding is always a concern ... but for now, for Africa, the plan is not to distribute vaccines or vaccinate large numbers of people against a few cases of monkeypox which we have seen in the past,"" Bartholomew Dicky Akanmor, adviser for vaccine research and regulation with the WHO's Africa office, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In Ghana, the director general of the country's health service, Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, said that in contrast to COVID-19 ""there is no cause for alarm"". ""We are monitoring and looking at the numbers and if we see a particular group at high risk, we will vaccinate as is being done in countries like the U.S.,"" he added. Within those countries that are vaccinating, experts are also warning about uneven access among certain groups - from those without an internet connection to undocumented migrants and people of colour. In the United States, data indicates that, similar to HIV, monkeypox is disproportionately impacting Black and Latino men. Yet white men are more likely to access the vaccine. In New York City, the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 3,000 cases, recent data showed that while a respective 34% and 29% of monkeypox diagnoses have been among Latinos and Blacks, those groups have received only 23% and 12% of the available vaccine doses respectively. ""None of this should be surprising,"" said David J. Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition in Washington, DC. ""Healthcare in our country and responses to viruses are seldom democratised."" New York City's government has pledged $5 million to local community based organizations to promote vaccination among gay and bisexual men and transgender people of colour, as well as people of lower socioeconomic status. The Biden administration has set aside 50,000 extra vaccine doses for localities that focus on providing vaccinations to members of the LGBTQ+ community in a way that targets health inequities. As a part of this pilot programme, it aims to provide on-site vaccinations at two major upcoming events that draw many LGBTQ+ of color - Southern Decadence in Louisiana, and Black Pride in Atlanta, said Deputy Coordinator of the White House monkeypox response, Demetre Daskalakis.

Digital divide Seeking to ensure limited supplies go where most needed in hard-hit western Europe, the EU has bought 160,000 vaccine doses to share out among member states according to the number of registered cases. In Britain, more than 30,000 people have received their first vaccine dose out of an initial batch of 50,000 doses, but supplies are set to run out before a new shipment of 100,000 doses arrives in September, the UK Health Security Agency said. LGBTQ+ groups working with the British government to ensure the doses reach marginalised groups have voiced frustration, saying people without digital access are among those at risk of missing out. ""You need to be digitally engaged - and pushy almost - to get access, which we know from other aspects of healthcare and HIV prevention will disadvantage groups who face health inequality,"" said Danny Beales, head of policy and campaigns at the Aids Trust charity. Doses in Britain are primarily being administered through sexual health clinics and pop-up ""super vaccination"" events, which see a lower attendance by members of minority groups, said Will Nutland, co-founder of Prepster. Instead, Nutland and a coalition of public health nonprofits have been organising smaller drop-in vaccination sessions aimed at men and trans people from ethnic minorities, including migrants, who might fear having their data registered. Still, the biggest concern among most health advocates is simply the shortage of supplies. ""Services have run out and lots of them are closing walk-in access,"" said Beales. ""There simply isn't enough vaccine to meet need and demand."""

Mexico ranks ninth globally in total cases, according to the World Health Organization, but officials have not announced plans to acquire vaccines even as other Latin American countries receive shipments. ""It's been a long journey to find a vaccine,"" said Alberto Herbel, a communications professional and nightlife producer who flew from Mexico City to Los Angeles this month for a two-day stay to get vaccinated after failed attempts in France and Germany.

Herbel, 38, said he wanted the vaccine because half of his friends currently have or have had monkeypox. The viral disease, which is overwhelmingly but not exclusively spreading among gay and bisexual men, is rarely fatal but can cause painful sores that make basic bodily functions difficult for weeks.

The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends vaccines for at-risk individuals and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has underscored they are an ""important tool"" in stemming transmission, though the shots are in short supply globally. Mexico City resident Juan David Zuluaga, 32, flew to Tijuana last week to get vaccinated across the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego.

""I didn't see a plan from the government,"" he said. ""I had to do something for myself."" Mexico's health ministry did not respond to Reuters' questions about plans to acquire vaccines.

Juan Carlos Lara, who owns a store in Mexico City's historic center, got vaccinated while vacationing in San Francisco last month. ""It was quick. They didn't ask for anything,"" said Lara, 41, who like others plans to make a second trip to get the recommended second dose.

Mexico's government has reported 2,147 confirmed cases of monkeypox since May, a number advocates in the gay community say far undercounts cases. Mexico is not among 14 countries that have committed to purchasing vaccines through PAHO, which acquired 130,000 doses of the Danish manufacturer Bavarian Nordic's JYNNEOS vaccine. Brazil and Chile received first shipments earlier this month.

Clinical trials to evaluate JYNNEOS' effectiveness at preventing monkeypox are ongoing. The vaccine is approved for monkeypox in the United States, where a CDC study observed that monkeypox incidence was 14 times higher among unvaccinated males compared with those who had received a first dose of JYNNEOS. Ricardo Baruch, an LGBT health researcher, says he ""easily"" knows 40 people who have left Mexico for the vaccine, but worries the situation will exacerbate inequalities in the gay community.

""Those with visas and money will get vaccinated and those without will have to resign themselves to eventually getting monkeypox,"" Baruch said.

Naming diseases is a complicated business. To be useful, a name needs to be unique, descriptive, and memorable so it can be referenced easily, especially when medical situations become urgent. Though the easiest way to name illnesses may be just to give them identification numbers, that system becomes extraordinarily difficult to reference efficiently when time is of the essence.

It may seem intuitive to name diseases based on their origins or discovery locations; however, this approach also presents issues. As our world increasingly boasts a global citizenry, illnesses—and their names—can be spread across various cultures, making it essential to be sensitive to and inclusive of all who may encounter them.

In light of recent conversations about disease nomenclature, Stacker investigated how “monkeypox” and other disease names have caused controversy, using a collection of news, scientific, and government sources. While this is not an all-inclusive list of the issues surrounding the naming of diseases, it explores several fraught means by which illnesses are given nomenclature that becomes shorthand for public discussion.

Disease names tied to geographic locations

Naming illnesses based on where they were presumed to have originated was a common practice for decades. The “Spanish flu” from the early 1900s is just one of many toponymous diseases that earned its name based on a physical place. However, in 2015, the World Health Organization released new guidelines that advised against this practice. When an illness becomes irrevocably tied to a place, people from that place often face discrimination or violence—even if the illness is later proven to have come from someplace different.

One recent example of a toponymous disease causing backlash occurred at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when some people, including then-President Donald Trump, referred to the novel coronavirus as the “Wuhan flu” or the “Chinese virus.” Many experts and medical professionals spoke up, stating that the monikers were xenophobic and prompted anti-Asian hate.

Other diseases named after places include the Zika virus, named after the Zika Forest in Uganda; Marburg virus, named after Marburg, Germany, where more than 30 cases of the illness were recorded; and Middle East respiratory syndrome, named after being first found in Saudi Arabia.

Disease names connected to an animal species

The list of diseases named after animal species is long and includes monkeypox, swine flu, and mad cow disease, among others. Though it may seem harmless to name an illness using its presumed species of origin or a carrier species, WHO guidelines also warn against this practice. In the wake of swine flu (also known as H1N1) outbreaks in other countries in 2009, Egypt ordered the slaughter of all pig livestock in the country despite not having any cases, resulting in the killing of about 300,000 animals.

Most recently, the name “monkeypox” has incited people to attack primates in zoos and their natural habitats out of fear of contracting the virus. WHO officials have attempted to redirect disease prevention efforts to focus on human-to-human transmission, but the prevalence of the “monkeypox” name isn’t helping the cause. In addition, 29 experts wrote an article in August 2022 calling for the term “monkeypox” to be changed due to its racist connotations against Black people and people of African descent.

Disease names that include the name of an individual person

It’s not unusual for scientists to name their discoveries after themselves: Halley’s Comet, Verreaux’s sifaka, and Avogadro’s number are just a few examples. But when it comes to physical illnesses, the politics of having an individual’s name in the disease name becomes tricky. One such disease the WHO specifically named in its updated naming guidance is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, first described by neurologists Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Alfons Maria Jakob but named by a third neurologist, Walther Spielmeyer.

Names in this category are discouraged because they are not descriptive; however, the situation can be further complicated when the condition is named after a controversial figure. This is the case for Asperger’s syndrome, which is no longer an official diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association as of 2013. Hans Asperger was a Nazi scientist during the Second World War and was responsible for the deaths of dozens of children; however, his dark story was not revealed publicly for many years after the diagnosis became common. The physical and mental conditions initially associated with Asperger’s syndrome are now classified under the diagnosis of autism. However, laypeople still use the name despite its removal from official medical practices.

Disease names that refer to a group of people

At the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and before the virus had been studied in-depth, it was called “gay-related immunodeficiency” because of its prevalence among homosexual men. At the time, it was assumed that sexual orientation had to be a causal agent of the disease. Though it is now known that HIV is not caused by sexual orientation but is transmitted by sexual contact or contact with infected blood, homophobia still lingers around the disease, serving as a warning for future disease names to mitigate discrimination caused by nomenclature.

Beyond HIV, controversy ensued during outbreaks of H1N1, or swine flu, in Israel. Because Israel has large Jewish and Muslim populations, many of its citizens took offense to the reference to pigs in the flu’s name because pigs are neither kosher nor halal. As a result, Israel’s deputy health minister announced that the illness would instead be called “Mexican flu,” based on the finding that the first human H1N1 patient was Mexican. This caused the Mexican ambassador to Israel to launch an official complaint against the Israeli government, ultimately resulting in Israel’s acceptance of the term “swine flu” after all.

She also highlighted CDC outreach at a time when the disease was brand new to most frontline clinicians.

Early missteps, declining cases

Sen Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, opened the hearing by saying the federal response has been a failure. He also said the CDC is an agency unwilling to change and think outside the box for infectious disease threats.

Sen Patty Murray, D-Washington, said too many missteps across federal agencies led to a few hundred cases growing to more than 20,000 over the course of the summer.

""It is unacceptable to communities that already experience difficulties accessing healthcare, like the LGBTQ+ communities,"" she said.

Murray said many people experienced significant delays in accessing tests and getting results. She asked Walensky why testing was so challenging during the first weeks of the outbreak.

Walensky said patients and clinicians likely did not recognize this new infection early on, which has largely been unseen in the United States. She also said people were requesting tests with no symptoms or rash, and the current test requires swabbing active lesions.

""To address these access issues, we had to work with clinicians, we had to do an extraordinary outreach so providers would know how to test and patients would know when to come in to test,"" she said. Walensky also said the nation has continued to grow its capacity to test for the virus, and partnered with commercial labs to expedite testing.

In her testimony, Walensky said the outbreak is slowing substantially in the country.

""We approach this news with cautious optimism,"" she said.

The United States has the world's largest monkeypox outbreak, with 22,630 cases confirmed by the CDC as of yesterday. All 50 states have recorded cases.

Sustained spread still in MSM communities

Walensky also said the disease is still largely seen in networks of men who have sex with men (MSM), a message echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO) today in a report on global outbreak trends.

To date, 22 people have died worldwide during this outbreak, the WHO said, but there is no evidence of sustained spread outside MSM communities.

Weekly global cases declined 3.2% last week, with most of the cases reported from the Americas and Europe. Ten countries, with the United States at the head of the pack, account for more than 87% of cases. The next most-affected countries are Spain (6,947), Brazil (6,033), France (3,785), The United Kingdom (3,552), Germany (3,547), Peru (1,937), Canada (1,321), the Netherlands (1,195), and Colombia (938).

The country reporting the highest increase in the past week was Mexico. In the past week 24 countries reported an increase in the weekly number of cases. In contrast, 33 countries have reported no new cases in the past 21 days.

During a media briefing today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said, ""The downward trend in the global monkeypox outbreak is continuing. But as with COVID-19, this is not the time to relax or let down our guard.""

ECDC report shows no major changes

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) today posted a monkeypox situation update. The three countries reporting the highest 7-day average for new daily case are Luxembourg, Spain, and Austria. Cases are decreasing in 10 countries and rising in 9. Latvia, Slovakia, and Portugal have the largest decreases.

""Cases of MPX continue to be reported primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged between 18–50 years,"" the ECDC said. ""Although some severe cases (including encephalitis) have been reported during the current outbreak, the impact of the disease remains low for most cases.""

Three people in Europe have died from the disease, the ECDC said."

Latin America has confirmed around 16% of over 50,000 registered cases worldwide in the recent outbreak, almost exclusively in countries where it is not historically endemic.

However, a Latin American network of gay rights activists believes governments are drastically underreporting the extent of the outbreak, in part due to discrimination against men who have sex with men, among whom the disease has so far been circulating overwhelmingly through sex.

“The worst thing would be to decide that this will be controlled through herd immunity,” the AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s director, Dr. Jorge Saavedra, told Reuters. “The lesions are very painful; and you can’t just condemn people to suffer.”

“This is state sadism,” he said.

Activists, who gathered in Mexico City on Thursday at an event to call for stronger state responses, said it was unbelievable that Mexico – one of Latin America’s most populous and visited countries – would have only one-third the number of monkeypox cases as Peru, which confirmed its first case a month after Mexico.

“Are Peruvians having more sex than Mexicans? Sexologists have found no evidence,” Saavedra said at the event.

The situation is particularly worrying in Mexico, activists said, where there is just one centralized diagnostics center forcing people to wait and travel long distances.

Grassroots clinics for people living with HIV, who risk suffering much more severe effects of monkeypox, have meanwhile been flooded with patients, they said.

Mexico’s government in June issued a statement discouraging messaging that links gay and bisexual men to monkeypox to prevent discrimination.

“They stigmatized us 40 years ago during the AIDS crisis,” said HIV researcher Ricardo Forcada. “Now, they’re not helping us under the pretext of not stigmatizing us.”

Forcada said the network was prepared to take all available legal actions, including appealing to Mexico’s human rights commission. It hopes the governments will invest in targeted health campaigns and order vaccines.

“We don’t want this to turn into an endemic problem like other sexually transmitted diseases,” said Saavedra.

Soon after Memorial Day, however, these men, as well as transgender individuals and other queer people — GBTQ for short, because lesbians’ monkeypox risk is remote — were met head-on with harrowing reports about monkeypox’s often devastating and disfiguring effects on the body. Next came anger and frustration over what queer activists characterize as the Biden administration’s fumbling initial response to the outbreak.

Lost amid the frantic media and public health reports about monkeypox epidemiology, the delayed vaccine deliveries and the squabbling over how best to communicate about the virus are the millions of GBTQ people whose happiness, well-being and connection to one another have in many cases been considerably compromised by the mere threat of monkeypox infection.

“Life has sort of halted,” said Guillermo Rojas, 29, a Mexican citizen and public administration graduate student in New York City. “This was supposed to be the great summer that everything went back and opened.”

Dr. Alex Keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the LGBTQ-health-focused Fenway Institute in Boston, said the outbreak has “been extremely distressing for community members and is also triggering in that it harkens back to the early days of the AIDS epidemic. It has a chilling effect on people’s sense of community, cohesion and belonging.”

Fortunately, there has been at most one U.S. monkeypox death in the U.S. — a potential case in a severely immunocompromised person in Texas is under investigation — even as the national case count has swelled to 19,465 diagnoses. And after a slow start, the federal government has now doled out approximately 800,000 vaccine vials, with a heady supply arriving in short order.

But provided how the virus, which gives rise to unsightly lesions that in some cases cause excruciating pain, is overwhelmingly spreading during sex between men, the outbreak has cast a long shadow over the gay community.

Over 100 gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people responded to an NBC News online survey seeking to learn about how monkeypox has affected their lives. What this diverse cross-section of the community most had in common were missed opportunities. They wrote about sex they never had, dates they never went on and gatherings with friends they avoided.

All that avoidance, the respondents made evident, was enmeshed in a cat’s cradle of fear — of contagion, of pain and suffering, of lonely and potentially financially ruinous weeks of isolation at home should they contract the virus.

They spoke of a summer they had hoped would prove invincible but that for them has turned out to be anything but.

A decade of sexual liberation, interrupted

Over the past 10 years, the introduction of PrEP, the HIV prevention pill, and the emergence of landmark studies proving that successfully treating HIV blocks transmission of the virus have cultivated a resurgent sexual liberation among many GBTQ people. Long-standing anxieties about HIV have eased, and hookup apps have made meeting sexual partners as convenient as procuring takeout — hence the term “ordering in.” As a result, people like Rojas have felt free to explore and revel in sex in a way queer people haven’t since the AIDS epidemic brought to a crashing close the sexual freedoms gay men enjoyed during the 1970s.

Then, in 2020, a new viral plague kept all of society cooped up and longing for freedom.

“Post-Covid,” said Rojas, recalling how he experienced the free-spirited bacchanalia into which monkeypox arrived in New York City this spring, “everybody went crazy, and there were sex parties all over town.”

Monkeypox swiftly pushed the contemporary safer-sex playbook out the window. Queer people have been left scrambling for answers about how to protect themselves and have expressed bewilderment as they’ve struggled to process mixed messaging from public health leaders and journalists about what poses a substantial risk of infection.

Rojas was one of the first U.S. residents to receive the prized monkeypox vaccine, in late June. But even with the benefit of his first jab of the two-dose vaccine, he has still sharply curtailed what he had hoped would be a long-awaited libertine summer.

“I’ve stopped going to sex parties,” he said, given that public health authorities identified such gatherings of men as major monkeypox risk factors. “I also stopped having sex with people who live off their OnlyFans. I additionally stopped cruising at the gym, I did not continue to go to Fire Island, and I stopped attending orgies.”

Evidence suggests a recent tidal shift in sexual behaviors in responses to monkeypox. According to the American Men’s Internet Survey, which conducted an online poll in early August of 824 gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, 48% reported reducing their number of sexual partners because of the outbreak, while 50% reduced hook-ups and 49% reduced partners met on hookup apps or at sex venues.

“It’s just a small, temporary break until everybody gets the vaccine,” said Rojas, who remained so concerned about living in the nation’s monkeypox epicenter that he decamped to his family’s home in Mexico City for the summer.

Fighting over — and for — sexual freedom

Not everyone in the queer community has been on the same page regarding monkeypox precautions. Just as battles over mask mandates and school closures have turned neighbor against neighbor during the Covid pandemic, fierce internecine conflicts have arisen among GBTQ people this summer about the best ways to respond to and communicate about monkeypox.

Michael Weinstein, the president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, dusted off his outspoken antipathy toward PrEP and published a scathing rebuke of the sexual liberties the HIV-prevention pill has facilitated in an op-ed titled “Monkeypox Reckoning” in the Los Angeles Blade on Monday. Notorious for an unapologetically strident, moralizing and fear-based approach to HIV-prevention communication, one that is far out of step with that of the vast majority of the public health community, Weinstein decried “a wholesale abandonment of safer sex promotion in favor of PrEP.”

“There has always been a sex radical group that has defined gay liberation as absolute sexual freedom,” Weinstein wrote, blaming monkeypox on those freedoms.

For another man named Michael, who like some people interviewed preferred to go only by his first name to shield his privacy, protecting himself against monkeypox by sacrificing the very sexual freedoms that Weinstein castigates has come, he said, at a great cost.

“I am not changing my behavior with an attitude of cheerful, take-one-for-the-team compliance,” said Michael, 42, who works in education in Philadelphia. “Instead, I find the situation fearful, miserable and diminishing. I am experiencing this outbreak as a serious setback to something that is very important to me, namely sexual freedom.

“Sex,” he continued, “isn’t just a frivolous pastime. For many of us, sex has serious meaning, sex is one of the things that makes life worth living.”

After more than two years of Covid restrictions, the arrival on U.S. shores of yet another major virus has also dealt a blow to the already strained mental health of many queer people, said LaRon Nelson, an associate professor of nursing and public health at Yale University.

“The fear of contracting monkeypox and the concern about access to the vaccine have led people to isolate or continue to isolate,” Nelson said. “That chronic exposure to this type of stress also comes at the expense of their psychological well-being.”

J.J. Ryan, a bisexual trans man assigned female at birth, spent the height of the Covid pandemic transitioning.

“I felt like I was just surviving before. I wasn’t really living,” Ryan, 34, said of his pre-transition life. “So I was really excited to get out and live my life — for this to finally be my ‘hot boy summer.’” Instead, he said, he has sadly “sharply reduced” his sexual exploration.

Fears of resurgent discrimination

With so many broken social, romantic, familial and sexual connections lying in pieces around them, many of the respondents to NBC News’ survey said they further dreaded that the monkeypox outbreak would fuel discrimination, hate and even violence toward LGBTQ people.

There is evidence — including a recent attack in Washington, D.C. — that such fears are beginning to manifest.

“My greatest worry in all of this is the turning of the clock back to less and less acceptance society-wise,” said Ryan, who is a Ph.D. student and a policy researcher at a nonprofit research organization in Washington.

John Pachankis, a psychologist at the Yale School of Public Health, noted how for the past two decades, queer advocacy organizations have pushed “a narrative that gay people are just like everyone else” in a successful effort to secure many civil rights protections. He spoke to the conflict that members of this community now face when the particulars of gay sex lie at the heart of the monkeypox outbreak and, as during the AIDS crisis, have become fodder for intense public debate.

“In the context of the real threat of those rights’ being taken away,” Pachankis said, referring to the recent rising tide of anti-LGBTQ sentiment and policies in the U.S., “the last thing that you want to do is disconfirm that narrative — even if the picture is a little more nuanced, even if gay people do live distinct lives from straight people, even if they express their sexuality more creatively, some might say more authentically.”

Brian Minalga, 36, who is gender nonbinary and works in the HIV field in Seattle, said: “There’s this idea that there are good people with good behaviors having the good type of sex. It’s moralistic and puritanical.”

Recapitulating racial disparities

For queer people of color, the outbreak has brought an unwelcome recapitulation of the racial health disparities that have characterized both the HIV and the Covid epidemics in the U.S.

“We saw monkeypox start with more affluent white gay men, and then eventually it seeped into more diverse networks, and that includes men of color,” said Gregorio Millett, the director of public policy at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and various state and local health departments have reported that monkeypox is indeed already disproportionately affecting Blacks and Latinos. And yet outsize shares of the vaccines have tended to go to whites — thanks, health advocates say, to structural factors that favor access to more privileged members of society.

Watching such patterns play out “is painful,” said Carlos E. Rodríguez-Díaz, an associate professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, “because it’s a reminder of the presence of systemic racism.”

Matthew Rose, 36, a health equity advocate in Washington, D.C., spoke to the myriad ways he and his Black gay peers have been dehumanized over time. He said he feared that monkeypox, the very name of which evokes a racist trope, will only worsen matters.

“For Black gay men, the last thing you need is to add a whole other discussion where you become this Black vector of disease,” he said.

Three viruses, one sense of fear

For some GBTQ people, fears of contagion instilled during the height of the Covid pandemic have primed further anxieties about monkeypox. The rueful history of the early AIDS epidemic serves as yet another backdrop.

“I decided several weeks ago that intimate contact isn’t worth the risk until I am fully vaccinated and the infection rate is under control,” said Steven Dwyer, 68, who is retired and based out of Baltimore and has been living with HIV since the mid-1980s. “As a long-term AIDS survivor, I learned it’s better to get informed about disease outbreaks that could affect me.”

The plight of Jason, a Los Angeles-area screenwriter in his late 20s, is a particularly profound example of the way crippling anxieties about infectious disease can be all-consuming. Jason has lived with obsessive compulsive disorder since childhood. It causes him intense dread of contagion and contamination, as well as various compulsions in response to such thoughts and stimuli. Fear of Covid left him largely housebound. Now the monkeypox outbreak has magnified those fears just as he was starting to feel more comfortable with venturing outside.

Jason lives with his boyfriend, and they’re monogamous, so contracting monkeypox sexually isn’t a concern. But suggestions that casual contact or contaminated surfaces can transmit monkeypox have left him reluctant to push his luck with his OCD. Consequently, for Jason, it’s as if those cloistered first few months of the Covid pandemic never ended.

“I am probably one of the only people I know that still doesn’t really go out much,” he said.

Many other GBTQ people said monkeypox has led them to question going to crowded spaces, such as concerts, bars and clubs — enjoyable outings and chances to connect with fellow queer people after having lived through the lonely and dull height of Covid.

Jason has been agonizing over whether to attend an upcoming concert of a performer he loves, something he has been looking forward to for years since it got delayed because of the pandemic. And in a recent interview, Dwyer, who travels constantly, expressed concern about contracting monkeypox from hotel linens.

Worries about monkeypox transmission even led to the cancellation of a major concert at the Southern Decadence celebration in New Orleans, which takes place over Labor Day weekend — even though it was to have been held outdoors.

Ryan said that when he visited his family in Philadelphia before he got his first monkeypox vaccination, his mother was hesitant to hug him for fear of the virus. That only aggravated his own worries about perhaps unknowingly passing monkeypox to his young niece and nephew.

Such hesitance from family members, said Ben Rosen, a psychotherapist at Harlem United in New York, parallels the cold shoulder many gay men got during the early AIDS crisis, “where people are being told, ‘Oh maybe you shouldn’t come visit.’”

Recent research suggests, however, that anxieties about monkeypox transmission in public settings and other relatively casual scenarios are most likely misplaced or at least grossly overblown. According to research papers and reports from global health authorities, cases of nonsexual transmission are uncommon to rare.

Last week, Dwyer concluded that bed sheets don’t actually pose a substantial risk.

On an Aug. 19 call with reporters, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy for the White House’s monkeypox response, said he believes attending crowded concerts is generally a low-risk activity. Merely brushing by someone, he said, is likely to be “low or no risk.”

Christopher Vasquez, 39, the director of communications at the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, said: “I think we need to be very careful about overreacting and shutting down events. Especially after two-plus years of the LGBTQ community feeling the effects of loneliness and depression because of Covid.”

Praising the myriad ways queer activists have fought for a better response to monkeypox, including faster and broader access to vaccines, Keuroghlian of the Fenway Institute said, “The silver lining is to see the amazing ability of our community to organize with solidarity and to articulate their needs.”

There are signs such efforts are bearing fruit.

Recent reports suggest transmission slowdowns in New York, Chicago and San Francisco — likely the result, experts theorize, of changes in sexual behavior, increased vaccination and possibly immunity from past infection.

With the challenging summer coming to a close, Guillermo Rojas is freshly back in New York for the fall semester of his graduate studies at Columbia University. Sitting in Manhattan’s Lincoln Center on a humid late-summer afternoon just after a cloudburst, he expressed optimism over the future of the outbreak.

“As people start getting vaccinated and the second vaccine starts kicking in for most people, things should get back to normal,” he said.

He got his own second shot on Wednesday.

52,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latin-american-activists-say-inaction-monkeypox-will-condemn-people-su-rcna46128,MX,"Fever, Swollen Lymph Nodes","Contaminated Objects, Respiratory, close contact",WHO,Monkeypox,Mexico,true,"MEXICO CITY — Gay rights activists from across Latin America have called for the region’s governments to take firm steps to prevent the spread of monkeypox, saying a lack of will to provide vaccines and diagnose cases is hurting the region’s gay and bisexual men.

Latin America has confirmed around 16% of over 50,000 registered cases worldwide in the recent outbreak, almost exclusively in countries where it is not historically endemic.

However, a Latin American network of gay rights activists believes governments are drastically underreporting the extent of the outbreak, in part due to discrimination against men who have sex with men, among whom the disease has so far been circulating overwhelmingly through sex.

“The worst thing would be to decide that this will be controlled through herd immunity,” the AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s director, Dr. Jorge Saavedra, told Reuters. “The lesions are very painful; and you can’t just condemn people to suffer.”

“This is state sadism,” he said.

Activists, who gathered in Mexico City on Thursday at an event to call for stronger state responses, said it was unbelievable that Mexico — one of Latin America’s most populous and visited countries — would have only one-third the number of monkeypox cases as Peru, which confirmed its first case a month after Mexico.

“Are Peruvians having more sex than Mexicans? Sexologists have found no evidence,” Saavedra said at the event.

The situation is particularly worrying in Mexico, activists said, where there is just one centralized diagnostics center forcing people to wait and travel long distances.

Grassroots clinics for people living with HIV, who risk suffering much more severe effects of monkeypox, have meanwhile been flooded with patients, they said.

Mexico’s government in June issued a statement discouraging messaging that links gay and bisexual men to monkeypox to prevent discrimination.

“They stigmatized us 40 years ago during the AIDS crisis,” said HIV researcher Ricardo Forcada. “Now, they’re not helping us under the pretext of not stigmatizing us.”

Forcada said the network was prepared to take all available legal actions, including appealing to Mexico’s human rights commission. It hopes the governments will invest in targeted health campaigns and order vaccines.

“We don’t want this to turn into an endemic problem like other sexually transmitted diseases,” said Saavedra.

Soon after Memorial Day, however, these men, as well as transgender individuals and other queer people — GBTQ for short, because lesbians’ monkeypox risk is remote — were met head-on with harrowing reports about monkeypox’s often devastating and disfiguring effects on the body. Next came anger and frustration over what queer activists characterize as the Biden administration’s fumbling initial response to the outbreak.

Lost amid the frantic media and public health reports about monkeypox epidemiology, the delayed vaccine deliveries and the squabbling over how best to communicate about the virus are the millions of GBTQ people whose happiness, well-being and connection to one another have in many cases been considerably compromised by the mere threat of monkeypox infection.

“Life has sort of halted,” said Guillermo Rojas, 29, a Mexican citizen and public administration graduate student in New York City. “This was supposed to be the great summer that everything went back and opened.”

Dr. Alex Keuroghlian, a psychiatrist at the LGBTQ-health-focused Fenway Institute in Boston, said the outbreak has “been extremely distressing for community members and is also triggering in that it harkens back to the early days of the AIDS epidemic. It has a chilling effect on people’s sense of community, cohesion and belonging.”

Fortunately, there has been at most one U.S. monkeypox death in the U.S. — a potential case in a severely immunocompromised person in Texas is under investigation — even as the national case count has swelled to 19,465 diagnoses. And after a slow start, the federal government has now doled out approximately 800,000 vaccine vials, with a heady supply arriving in short order.

But provided how the virus, which gives rise to unsightly lesions that in some cases cause excruciating pain, is overwhelmingly spreading during sex between men, the outbreak has cast a long shadow over the gay community.

Over 100 gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people responded to an NBC News online survey seeking to learn about how monkeypox has affected their lives. What this diverse cross-section of the community most had in common were missed opportunities. They wrote about sex they never had, dates they never went on and gatherings with friends they avoided.

All that avoidance, the respondents made evident, was enmeshed in a cat’s cradle of fear — of contagion, of pain and suffering, of lonely and potentially financially ruinous weeks of isolation at home should they contract the virus.

They spoke of a summer they had hoped would prove invincible but that for them has turned out to be anything but.

A decade of sexual liberation, interrupted

Over the past 10 years, the introduction of PrEP, the HIV prevention pill, and the emergence of landmark studies proving that successfully treating HIV blocks transmission of the virus have cultivated a resurgent sexual liberation among many GBTQ people. Long-standing anxieties about HIV have eased, and hookup apps have made meeting sexual partners as convenient as procuring takeout — hence the term “ordering in.” As a result, people like Rojas have felt free to explore and revel in sex in a way queer people haven’t since the AIDS epidemic brought to a crashing close the sexual freedoms gay men enjoyed during the 1970s.

Then, in 2020, a new viral plague kept all of society cooped up and longing for freedom.

“Post-Covid,” said Rojas, recalling how he experienced the free-spirited bacchanalia into which monkeypox arrived in New York City this spring, “everybody went crazy, and there were sex parties all over town.”

Monkeypox swiftly pushed the contemporary safer-sex playbook out the window. Queer people have been left scrambling for answers about how to protect themselves and have expressed bewilderment as they’ve struggled to process mixed messaging from public health leaders and journalists about what poses a substantial risk of infection.

Rojas was one of the first U.S. residents to receive the prized monkeypox vaccine, in late June. But even with the benefit of his first jab of the two-dose vaccine, he has still sharply curtailed what he had hoped would be a long-awaited libertine summer.

“I’ve stopped going to sex parties,” he said, given that public health authorities identified such gatherings of men as major monkeypox risk factors. “I also stopped having sex with people who live off their OnlyFans. I additionally stopped cruising at the gym, I did not continue to go to Fire Island, and I stopped attending orgies.”

Evidence suggests a recent tidal shift in sexual behaviors in responses to monkeypox. According to the American Men’s Internet Survey, which conducted an online poll in early August of 824 gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, 48% reported reducing their number of sexual partners because of the outbreak, while 50% reduced hook-ups and 49% reduced partners met on hookup apps or at sex venues.

“It’s just a small, temporary break until everybody gets the vaccine,” said Rojas, who remained so concerned about living in the nation’s monkeypox epicenter that he decamped to his family’s home in Mexico City for the summer.

Fighting over — and for — sexual freedom

Not everyone in the queer community has been on the same page regarding monkeypox precautions. Just as battles over mask mandates and school closures have turned neighbor against neighbor during the Covid pandemic, fierce internecine conflicts have arisen among GBTQ people this summer about the best ways to respond to and communicate about monkeypox.

Michael Weinstein, the president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, dusted off his outspoken antipathy toward PrEP and published a scathing rebuke of the sexual liberties the HIV-prevention pill has facilitated in an op-ed titled “Monkeypox Reckoning” in the Los Angeles Blade on Monday. Notorious for an unapologetically strident, moralizing and fear-based approach to HIV-prevention communication, one that is far out of step with that of the vast majority of the public health community, Weinstein decried “a wholesale abandonment of safer sex promotion in favor of PrEP.”

“There has always been a sex radical group that has defined gay liberation as absolute sexual freedom,” Weinstein wrote, blaming monkeypox on those freedoms.

For another man named Michael, who like some people interviewed preferred to go only by his first name to shield his privacy, protecting himself against monkeypox by sacrificing the very sexual freedoms that Weinstein castigates has come, he said, at a great cost.

“I am not changing my behavior with an attitude of cheerful, take-one-for-the-team compliance,” said Michael, 42, who works in education in Philadelphia. “Instead, I find the situation fearful, miserable and diminishing. I am experiencing this outbreak as a serious setback to something that is very important to me, namely sexual freedom.

“Sex,” he continued, “isn’t just a frivolous pastime. For many of us, sex has serious meaning, sex is one of the things that makes life worth living.”

After more than two years of Covid restrictions, the arrival on U.S. shores of yet another major virus has also dealt a blow to the already strained mental health of many queer people, said LaRon Nelson, an associate professor of nursing and public health at Yale University.

“The fear of contracting monkeypox and the concern about access to the vaccine have led people to isolate or continue to isolate,” Nelson said. “That chronic exposure to this type of stress also comes at the expense of their psychological well-being.”

J.J. Ryan, a bisexual trans man assigned female at birth, spent the height of the Covid pandemic transitioning.

“I felt like I was just surviving before. I wasn’t really living,” Ryan, 34, said of his pre-transition life. “So I was really excited to get out and live my life — for this to finally be my ‘hot boy summer.’” Instead, he said, he has sadly “sharply reduced” his sexual exploration.

Fears of resurgent discrimination

With so many broken social, romantic, familial and sexual connections lying in pieces around them, many of the respondents to NBC News’ survey said they further dreaded that the monkeypox outbreak would fuel discrimination, hate and even violence toward LGBTQ people.

There is evidence — including a recent attack in Washington, D.C. — that such fears are beginning to manifest.

“My greatest worry in all of this is the turning of the clock back to less and less acceptance society-wise,” said Ryan, who is a Ph.D. student and a policy researcher at a nonprofit research organization in Washington.

For queer people of color, the outbreak has brought an unwelcome recapitulation of the racial health disparities that have characterized both the HIV and the Covid epidemics in the U.S.

MEXICO CITY—Mexico and Cuba have reported the deaths of two people who had tested positive for monkeypox, although neither country attributed the fatalities to the viral disease.

The reports follow monkeypox-related deaths reported in Brazil and Ecuador in the past month, but fatalities remain rare in the current outbreak.

The Pan-American Health Organization has reported at least 21,200 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the Americas, and over 80 countries worldwide have reported new cases of the illness, which is endemic in parts of Africa.

Mexico’s health ministry on Tuesday said experts were investigating the death of an HIV-positive patient who had died from septic shock and pneumonia after testing positive for monkeypox.

Mexico has reported 386 confirmed and 862 probable cases of monkeypox infection.

Cuban authorities said a 50-year-old Italian man died on Aug. 21 after being diagnosed with monkeypox on Aug. 20.

The public health ministry said the tourist, who had arrived on Aug. 15, had been in an unstable condition since Thursday and rapidly deteriorated.

The ministry pointed to an autopsy report that reported the cause of death as sepsis linked to pneumonia and organ damage."

Mexico’s health ministry said Tuesday (23 August) that health officials were investigating the death of someone living with HIV that tested positive for monkeypox.

The patient passed away from septic shock and pneumonia, the ministry added according to Reuters. Mexican experts stressed the man did not die of monkeypox.

Cuba’s Ministry of Public Health confirmed that an Italian tourist passed away on 21 August only one day after recording its first case.

The 50-year-old man travelled across the island for only three days before developing symptoms including skin lesions before his condition rapidly deteriorated.

A post-mortem “showed the cause of death was sepsis due to bronchopneumonia”, or pneumonia of the lungs, as well as organ failure. Health officials did not attribute the man’s death to monkeypox, where deaths remain rare.

“Through the studies carried out from the beginning to look for possible associated causes that may have conditioned his seriousness, other pathologies and infectious aetiology were ruled out,” it added.

The ministry said that the man’s close contacts are in isolation and have yet to show any of the disease’s hallmark symptoms.

According to the Centers for Disease and Prevention, there have been at least 13 confirmed deaths since the outbreak began in May. With Mexico and Peru, this brings up the death toll to 15.

Deaths of the virus remain very rare, with deaths of monkeypox patients so far confirmed in Peru, India, Brazil and Spain.

The Pan American Health Organisation has confirmed 25,000 monkeypox cases in the Americas.

Like in many other parts of the world, Mexico’s monkeypox cases have so far been recorded disproportionately among men who have sex with men, according to the country’s Institute for Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference.

More than 99 per cent worldwide of those infected have been men who have sex with men, prompting health officials to roll out targeted public messaging and vaccination campaigns.

But worldwide, cases have been steadily slowing down. With more than 46,000 confirmed cases worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) found cases had dropped by 21 per cent in the past week, sparking hopes that efforts to contain the outbreak are proving successful.

But the largest institutions in Albuquerque and Las Cruces don’t have special measures set in place for the national public health emergency.

Instead, university officials are putting a lot of the responsibility on students to be mindful of the potential health risk.

The first case of monkeypox was found in New Mexico on July 11. About a month and a half later, that number has risen to 19 cases. There are over 15,900 confirmed cases throughout the U.S. and no deaths so far.

Symptoms The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed the following symptoms for monkeypox: Rash

Fever

Chills

Swollen lymph nodes

Exhaustion

Muscle aches and backache

Headache

Respiratory symptoms (sore throat, nasal congestion or cough) Symptoms typically start within three weeks of exposure. Not everyone has all the symptoms. People who think they’re at risk for monkeypox can call the N.M. Department of Health at 1-855-3453 (option four) for a consultation or self-register online. Only those deemed highly at risk can get vaccinated.

The University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University have no precautionary measures set in place for monkeypox specifically.

Both Eastern and Western New Mexico Universities have isolated quarantine spaces available on campus that could be used for monkeypox if needed.

The lack of action by UNM and NMSU, the largest universities in the state, reflects the absence of state and national standards to follow for the health crisis.

Instead, most colleges are just sharing information about monkeypox to students, staff and faculty. UNM spokesperson Cinnamon Blair said the university’s goal is to address the false rumors about monkeypox spreading in the public.

UNM is also encouraging students to maintain rigorous health standards, Blair said. Western New Mexico University’s Betsy Miller, interim vice president of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management, responded similarly.

“The wellbeing of WNMU students is our top priority, and we hold that it is the responsibility of every (student) to maintain their own health and to do their part to protect their classmates, co-workers, teammates and peers,” Miller said via email.

NMSU’s Special Assistant to the Vice Chancellor Jon Webster said monkeypox isn’t a concern right now. Blair agreed and said UNM will consult with health partners to set up safety measures later on if it becomes necessary. Both said the issue might become more concerning if cases rise.

“We’ve worked our way through it through an entire two years of COVID,” Webster said. “I have no doubt we could do it if we needed to with this same virus.”

Dr. Meghan Brett, epidemiologist with UNM Hospital, said this outreach is a good response so communities are attentive to symptoms like rashes or fever.

Limited vaccine availability Currently, only people deemed highly at risk can schedule an appointment to get vaccinated. NMDOH spokesperson David Morgan said applicants will be screened for sexual history, travel and other things. Right now, the state has about 1,000 Jynneos vaccine vials, he said, which can be enough for roughly 4,000 first and second doses.

But some other officials think more needs to be done. States Newsroom talked with Georges C. Benjamin, American Public Health Association executive director, who said colleges should be putting contingency measures in place and assuming they’ll have monkeypox cases.

“There’s nothing to say they’ll have big outbreaks, but all schools should assume that they’re going to have somebody on their campus that has monkeypox,” Benjamin said. “The outbreak is just too widespread for that not to be the case.”

Still, some universities are still struggling to cope with just one public health emergency. Jeff Long is the vice president for student affairs at Eastern New Mexico University and said the COVID-19 pandemic is at the forefront of their minds.

“Right now, we’re still dealing with COVID as students and faculty come back to campus,” he said.

But he said the university would transition to online classes if it comes to it. After COVID, many universities boosted their online presence and still have virtual options available for students.

Contracting the virus

Many college students travel over summer break, and because New Mexico has the 15th-lowest case count in the country, students may come back from states with higher monkeypox cases.

N.M. flanked by monkeypox in surrounding states All of New Mexico’s neighboring states have higher cases of monkeypox. Texas alone has over 1,300, the fourth-highest count in the U.S.

But monkeypox doesn’t spread as easily as COVID, Brett said, and it’s most likely after skin-to-skin contact.

Because of this, Brett said traveling itself may not increase the risk of contracting monkeypox but rather the activities done while traveling. The virus can be contracted from unprotected sexual activities, she said. This may be prevalent on college campuses, which is why she said it must be discussed.

“This is where people need to continue to talk about what needs to be in place by way of safe sex practices,” Brett said.

She said communication with partners about rashes or exposures is meaningful as well as getting personal rashes checked out. “That’s important whether it’s monkeypox, syphilis, gonorrhea or other types of sexually transmitted infections,” she said.

Monkeypox can also spread through sharing objects, fabrics or surfaces with someone who has the virus. Dorms are one of the higher-risk settings the CDC lists where transmission may be more likely after someone contracts the virus. The center recommends testing residents who might have monkeypox, providing them with masks to wear and disinfecting areas.

Brett said contracting the virus through other commonly shared items on campuses like desks or equipment is less likely.

UNM and NMSU recommend students contact their health centers if they believe they’ve been exposed, though vaccines are only available through the N.M. Department of Health.

The quarantine for monkeypox is longer than COVID. The CDC says people should stay isolated while symptoms persist, which usually lasts two to four weeks — a prolonged period that could cause issues for students missing classes and work.

Stigmatization

The majority of monkeypox cases are seen in men who have sex with other men, according to the CDC. This has caused issues of communities like gay men being stigmatized amid the crisis, though Brett said public health care workers are trying to avoid that.

“When in health care, we try to do our best, right, to treat everybody who comes to see us fairly and equally and hopefully without stigma,” Brett said.

She said the public should try to personalize how they think about who could contract the disease to avoid stigmatization. “The individuals who go on to develop monkeypox could be your brother or your son or someone else that you care about,” Brett said.

Blair said that there are mental health resources available at UNM for those struggling with anxiety around the issue and wants everyone to feel safe getting medical help if it’s needed. She added that the campus doesn’t create issues that would single out one community so everyone is supported.

“We want people to feel comfortable talking about it, going to a health care provider, not feeling bad about it,” Blair said. “It’s just coming on the heels of all the COVID stuff. It’s just one more thing.”"

23rd Tuesday, August 2022 - 09:35 UTC Full article

The content of these campaigns needs to be approved by the Electoral Justice to avoid undue political gain, Queiroga also explained

Brazil's Health Ministry Monday launched an awareness campaign on monkeypox, to inform the population about transmission, contagion, and symptoms of the malady.

Under the motto Monkey Pox: Get Well with the Right Information, the Ministry of Health launched Monday in Brasilia the National Campaign for the Prevention of the disease to make the population aware of the transmission, infection, symptoms, and prevention. The initiative includes tips on what to do when monkeypox is suspected.

Over 41,500 cases of the disease have been registered worldwide. In Brazil, according to the data from August 21, there were 3,788 confirmed infections.

The new campaign warns that the main form of prevention is to avoid contact with infected people or contaminated objects, such as cups, cutlery, sheets, and towels.

The authorities also highlighted that the incubation phase of the virus can last from 5 to 21 days, during which it is possible to have transmission. As per the recorded cases, contagion occurs, especially through physical skin-to-skin contact with lesions or body fluids.

In infected people, fever, skin rashes, swollen glands (swelling of the tongue), body aches, exhaustion, and chills are the most common symptoms.

Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga pointed out that there is no specific treatment for the disease but it does not mean there is no treatment at all. According to Queiroga, symptoms such as pain can be alleviated with specific measures. He also discussed the difference between monkeypox and COVID-19.

The lethality of this disease is low. The virus is different. The COVID-19 virus is the RNA virus. So it is the virus that mutates more frequently whereas the DNA virus [of monkeypox] has a lower potential to mutate, which fools even vaccines that are developed with sophisticated technologies, he explained.

The Ministry of Health started last month negotiations with the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and the WHO for the purchase of 50,000 doses of vaccine against the disease. It is necessary that a contract be signed by the Ministry of Health with PAHO, to make this very clear so that we have a forecast for the delivery of these vaccines. The forecast was that they would be delivered at the end of August. Socorro [Gross, representative of PAHO] informed me that it would be the beginning of September. There would be two shipments, but now there are three. There is a shortage of this input worldwide, Queiroga went on.

Last Friday, the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) authorized the exceptional import of medicines and vaccines that are still unregistered in Brazil. The first of three shipments is due in early September. About these immunizers, Marcelo Queiroga explained that since the complete immunization requires two doses, they will be enough to vaccinate 25 thousand people. First to receive the vaccine will be health care professionals who work directly with the virus.

As with vaccines, since there is no representative of the antiviral in Brazil, the Ministry of Health also requested PAHO to purchase 10 doses of tecovirimat for immediate treatment, and another 50 units for severe cases. The ministry is also negotiating 12 more units donated by the producer laboratory, and the purchase of 504 more doses.

The campaign launch Monday comes after Justice Edson Fachin of the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) authorized the federal government to run advertisements on the theme until August 30.

Brazilian electoral legislation forbids any institutional publicity that may configure the abusive use of the public machinery for the promotion of rulers during the three months before the elections, so it needed to be analyzed by the Electoral Justice. In his decision, Fachin pointed out that the campaign is of public interest. Also according to Fachin's ruling, all campaign material must be posted on a specific page about monkeypox.

Queiroga said he was still waiting for clearance from the TSE to record a broadcast with technical information about monkeypox for the population.

According to the Florida Department of Health's Reportable Disease Frequency Report, the pediatric case was from Martin County and involved a child between 0-4 years old, according to WEAR-TV. No further details were given by the authorities about the pediatric monkeypox patient in the Sunshine State.

How the Florida child got the virus was unclear, but Pinellas County's Florida Department of Health Director Dr. Ulyee Choe said most cases of monkeypox in children are because by household transmission.

The pediatric monkeypox patient in Florida is the seventh child in the United States to have been infected by the monkeypox virus.

The World Health Organization previously acknowledged that there have been a small number of children with monkeypox in the current outbreak. WHO added that newborn infants and people with underlying immune deficiencies are also at risk of more serious symptoms of monkeypox.

Parents Should Not Worry About Monkeypox School Transmission - Experts

In an interview with Fox 35 on Wednesday, Dr. Ulyee Choe also assured that parents should not worry about monkeypox during the back-to-school season.

""I don't believe that schools especially the K-12 are gonna be bid drivers of this [monkeypox], but with that being said I can tell you that the majority of the school districts throughout the state have protocols in place for a child that presents with rash,"" Choe underscored.

Choe also previously noted that they will continue to monitor the situation.

Monkeypox is spread by having prolonged skin-to-skin contact with someone. The said disease is reportedly impacting men who have sex with men, but experts believe that the disease could potentially spread into new groups.

In an interview Dr, Bob Wallace underscored the importance of not stigmatizing the disease, contending that the move can lead to other groups letting their guard down against the disease.

""The way I tend to explain that just as with college students, the particular groups are very social they tend to have large parties as you'll see pool parties for example. It doesn't matter whether you're gay or straight,"" Dr. Wallace pointed out.

Monkeypox Cases in Florida

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recorded that there are 1,346 cases of monkeypox throughout Florida as of Wednesday. The state is among the top five states in the U.S. that surpassed the 1,000-mark.

As of Monday, the Sunshine State reported eight cases of monkeypox among teenagers ages 15-to-19 years old.

Florida's Escambia County and Santa Rosa County each have one probable case.

New York and California remain the top two states who have the most cases of monkeypox. According to the data from CDC, the Empire State recorded 2,675 cases while the Golden State recorded 2,356 as of August 17. All in all, 13,517 cases of monkeypox were recorded as of Wednesday acrss the U.S.

However, the growth in case numbers has plateaued. Acting Health Secretary Dr. David Scrase and Deputy Health Secretary Dr. Laura Parajon both spoke about the diseases. KUNM’s Jered Ebenreck attended the online briefing and talked to All Things Considered Host, Nash Jones, about how the health officials described the state of the pandemic in New Mexico.

JERED EBENRECK: Both secretaries use the word plateaued to describe current trends and case counts and hospitalizations. Although we may be in one of the biggest waves of cases since the start of the pandemic, once you factor in unreported home tests and hospitalizations, which are also stable, but still twice as high as last summer. But Scrase did point out how disturbing the body count continues to be.

DR. DAVID SCRASE: In New Mexico, we're still not out of the woods. Anytime you're having 10 deaths a day for a really long time. That means a significant impact on individuals and families and communities that we can't forget.

EBENRECK: I pointed out that in terms of all time, COVID mortality rate, New Mexico is now the fifth highest, 394 deaths per 100,000 people, both secretaries argued that such numbers need to be parsed, when it comes to the unique characteristics of New Mexico's population,

SCRASE: We have the highest social vulnerability index in America, the highest state vulnerability index, so that I don't really pay a lot of attention to where do we rank compared to other states, because it's not corrected for all the individual population characteristics

KUNM: So it sounds like he's saying it may not be fair to compare New Mexico's high death rate because of factors like age and race and poverty in the state's population. Is that right?

EBENRECK: Correct. They're saying that the state has a pre-existing condition that makes it a little bit more vulnerable than other states.

KUNM: CNN reported Wednesday that the CDC is intending to amend the guidance it gives based on COVID community levels, which is the measure recommended to determine risk that combines transmission with hospital ICU space and the number of hospitalizations in a community. The changes include things like de-emphasizing social distancing, adjusting quarantine timelines, and upping the emphasis on things like ventilation. It may also impact the test-to-stay program at Albuquerque Public Schools though the district so far has said that they will maintain that policy. So how does this potential CDC update impact New Mexico's guidance?

EBENRECK: Well, Dr. Scrase indicated that they normally default to CDC guidance, pending review and an effort to cater the guidance to the state.

SCRASE: If there's something in there that wouldn't work well for our unique and diverse and high social socially vulnerable New Mexico population, we do tweak it.

EBENRECK: He didn't comment on the specifics of any of the projected updates. Both secretaries continue to point to the CDC Quarantine and Isolation Calculator , a web based tool people can use to determine what to do after being exposed and commended paying attention to the green, yellow. and orange guidance from the CDC Community Levels metric –about a third of New Mexicans by DHS estimates are at risk for serious illness from COVID-19. Neither Secretary addressed any of the specific recommendations CNN reported.

KUNM: And so switching gears just a little bit, as of this week, New Mexico has 10 cases of Monkeypox , according to the CDC. What did Dr. Parajón say about how the state's responding to this close contact virus ?

EBENRECK: Well, Dr. Parajon ran through the pathology of Monkeypox, pointing out how it's transmitted–close contact with persons including sex or personal items of an infected person. She went through symptoms, which are very much like early flu like symptoms followed potentially by painful lesions; incubation period–that it takes about one to two weeks for the disease to appear with symptoms and then it may last up to two to four weeks. She emphasized the importance of avoiding stigma around the disease by highlighting how the disease is spread, not who is spreading it

DR. LAURA PARAJÓN: Anybody can get monkeypox regardless of sexual orientation, gender or gender identity.

EBENRECK: She also pointed out that screening and appointments for the Monkeypox vaccine are essential because there are limited doses available at the moment in the state, so not all New Mexicans should pursue vaccination at this time, only those at higher risk of exposure are eligible. If you wonder whether you may be at risk DOH encourages you to call to be screened for vaccination, which is most effective within the first 4 days of exposure.

PARAJÓN: If you are at risk for monkey pox, and you're interested in a vaccine, you can call our call center at 1-855-600-3453."

Show Caption Hide Caption Monkeypox survivor shares concerns over lack of response by government Monkeypox has now been declared a ""public health emergency"" as the U.S. works to release more vaccines in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Patrick Colson-Price, USA TODAY

New Mexico health officials said Thursday that COVID-19 case averages continued to hold at a plateau over the summer and that approximately 250 doses of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine had been administered in an effort to slow community transmission of that virus.

Both public health emergencies were addressed in a video news conference with acting state Health Secretary Dr. David Scrase and interim state epidemiologist Dr. Laura Parajón.

Epidemiological data presented Thursday showed that while overall COVID-19 infection based on seven-day case averages remained high across the state, the average has held at a plateau across the summer months. The data is based on lab-confirmed PCR tests, however, and does not account for positive results from home tests.

Scrase said there were no indicators that the trend would move downward soon, and national health experts have predicted rises in transmission during the fall and winter months, currently driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of SARS-CoV-2's omicron strain.

Repeating a message from recent monthly news conferences, Scrase said that the state health department is monitoring strain on the state's healthcare system as a higher priority than daily case data. The rate of hospitalizations for COVID-19 has also remained at a plateau while the percentage of patients placed on ventilators has decreased with improved treatment options and vaccinations, which he said are ""the most effective way to reduce your risk of getting serious complications, like hospitalization or death or even long COVID.""

""Long COVID"" refers to patients, as many as 1 in 5 by some estimates, who experience long-term complications following a bout with the disease.

Scrase acknowledged a recent uptick in deaths attributed by physicians to COVID-19, but maintained odds of a fatal case have decreased under the current subvariants compared to 2021 deadly tides by the delta variant and initial iteration of omicron.

As more children begin school, Scrase recommended this as a good time for them and family members to get updated on vaccines or boosters, as eligible. He said that those who have held out because of concerns with the mRNA technology used in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines now have an alternative available to them: Novavax, a protein-based vaccine that does not use mRNA technology, is available through 13 providers in New Mexico.

Scrase said that while a new vaccine targeting omicron strains might be authorized for use as soon as September, he did not recommend waiting for it to get a booster.

Vaccinations for COVID-19 are offered free of charge. Information on locations and appointments is available online at https://VaccineNM.org.

Again stating there were no discussions of resorting to public health restrictions to curb transmission, he recommended New Mexicans be aware of COVID-19 community levels in their area as measured by the CDC and follow its guidance accordingly, to stay up-to-date on vaccination, and wear an N95 or KN95 mask in appropriate situations.

The CDC website publishes a ""community level"" map, which assesses county-level COVID-19 vulnerability based on case data as well as hospital admissions and available beds.

On Thursday, the map showed most of southern New Mexico at a medium level, while 11 of 33 counties, including the northwestern corner and highly populous Bernalillo County, at high. At that level, the CDC recommends well-fitting mask use for indoor public settings regardless of vaccine status.

The CDC's map of community transmission, meanwhile, showed New Mexico almost entirely red: 31 of 33 counties, with the exception of Harding and De Baca counties, measured high rates of transmission based on daily case data and test positivity rates.

""What we're trying to do is encourage everyone in New Mexico to do their part, to wear their masks in a time that's red or yellow, to do all those things and to get on board to help us all come together to minimize all those numbers,"" Scrase said.

New Mexico monkeypox update, symptoms

Parajón said New Mexico has now confirmed 10 cases of monkeypox out of 6,617 nationwide. All 10 cases were reportedly acquired out of state, with no known transmission within New Mexico, but Scrase said presumably there would eventually be community transmission.

To slow the spread while conserving tight supplies of the Jynneos vaccine, Parajón said priority was being given to higher-risk individuals, such as those with known recent contact with others who had monkeypox.

Also Thursday, the Biden administration declared the monkeybox outbreak a public health emergency, a move that could make it easier to tap funding to combat the once-rare disease, USA TODAY reported.

While the highest proportion of early cases was found among men engaging in sexual contact with other men and had multiple partners, Parajón emphasized that anyone can contract monkeypox regardless of sexual orientation.

""We don't want to stigmatize people,"" she said. ""It just happened to get in to one group in particular first, but anybody who comes into contact with monkeypox is at risk of getting monkeypox.""

While hospitalization or death were rare, the illness can mimic symptoms of flu in early stages and is characterized by painful lesions or blisters.

It may be spread through skin-to-skin contact, especially direct contact with the monkeypox rash or scabs. It can also be transmitted through surfaces or fabrics such as linens and clothing. Intimate contact such as sexual interaction, kissing and massage can also spread the illness but not, she said, casual conversation or walking past someone who has an active case.

The health department advised any individual who thinks they may have been exposed to contact a health provider or public health clinic. If symptoms, develop, the guidance is to avoid close contact with other people. A provider will use a skin test to check for monkeypox, with results coming in one or two days.

Jynneos is an FDA-approved vaccine that Parajón said is safe and effective. While it is most effective in the first four days of transmission, she said vaccination is worthwhile up to 21 days, given that it can take two weeks to fully overcome infection. Vaccines are administered by appointment only.

All cases of monkeypox reported in Argentina are male, the Health Ministry said

The Argentine LGBT+ Federation has launched an appeal to national health authorities to launch a nationwide vaccination campaign for the entire population against monkeypox.

The group also asked for healthcare practitioners to be properly trained on how to detect the malady.

The federation then requested prevention campaigns be conducted free of stigmatizing messages towards LGBT+ people. According to reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other leading scientific institutions, almost 100% of monkeypox cases had been found among men who have sex with men.

The WHO declared an international emergency due to the worldwide spread of the disease.

We ask the Minister of Health of the Nation, Carla Vizzotti, that the Ministry initiates a vaccination campaign and incorporates the smallpox vaccine in the vaccination calendar, launching -also- its production in the country, Flavia Massenzio, president of the Argentine LGBT+ Federation, said.

Monkeypox is transmitted mainly through prolonged and direct skin-to-skin contact with lesions produced by monkeypox. It can be through sexual intercourse, intimate contact such as kissing and hugging, or other physical contact, including sharing personal hygiene supplies or silverware. We encourage the Ministry to carry out preventive campaigns without discrimination, she added.

”There is a lot of information about it and there are also alarms that generate concern for us. Information has already circulated indicating that 'infections only occurred among men who have sex with men', the same thing that was intended (and at the beginning was achieved) to be introduced in the collective unconscious of the citizenship with the HIV issue, Massenzio insisted.

This was not so, and with monkeypox it is not so either: we are all exposed to contagion if we do not take the corresponding prevention measures, the LGBT leader went on.

For this reason, and with the experience that the LGBT+ community went through with the 'AIDS pandemic' during the 80s and 90s, we want to alert the Ministry of Health of the Nation about the stigma that attacked LGBT+ people in those years as 'main spreaders of infections' and that today is resumed with stigmatizing speeches from the WHO and some media, she pointed out.

All cases reported in Argentina are male, with an average age of 36 years, with cases with a maximum of 47 and a minimum of 24 years”, the Health Ministry said through a statement."

The headlines are grim enough that you might be worried that monkeypox is like SARS or Covid: another virus that could disrupt or even threaten your life. The good news is monkeypox is much less contagious and much less likely to be deadly than Covid. There are also vaccines and treatments originally developed for smallpox that work on monkeypox."

Then, a week later, lesions all over his body, his mouth so full of sores that he could barely talk or drink water.

""The pain was indescribable, catastrophic,"" said Francisco, 44, who asked Reuters to conceal his real name.

Francisco had one of at least 59 monkeypox infections confirmed in Mexico since May, which experts believe could undercount the true number.

In Latin America, Mexico ranks behind Brazil and Peru for confirmed cases of the viral disease, which has primarily spread among gay and bisexual men like Francisco.

The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global health emergency on July 23, prompting greater attention from regional officials. However, some doctors and activists in Latin America's two largest countries told Reuters the response has been too tepid.

""We are not seeing the necessary measures taken, nor the necessary importance given to monkeypox,"" said Dr. Sergio Montalvo, a sexual health specialist in Mexico City.

Doctors like Montalvo fear authorities have not learned lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has strained health systems and left governments strapped for cash.

The story is similar in Brazil, where over 970 infections represent over two-thirds of the region's total, per data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

Brazil's Health Ministry announced a contingency plan on July 28, over a month after its first case and a day before reporting the first monkeypox death outside Africa in the current outbreak.

""We were already receiving news about the outbreak in Europe and the United States, but the government didn't do anything,"" said Vinicius Borges, a infectious disease specialist in Sao Paulo. He said pain from monkeypox lesions has had ""serious effects"" on his patients.

Neither Mexico nor Brazil's health ministries responded to multiple requests for an interview.

Following the WHO declaration, Mexico's Health Ministry launched a website about monkeypox and its second advisory with information about the virus - its first since the country confirmed a case in May.

""In these two months, we could have already made significant progress,"" said Ricardo Baruch, an LGBT health researcher who helped organize a protest in Mexico City last week to ask for greater efforts to target prevention to men who have sex with men (MSM).

A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 98% of infections in the ongoing outbreak outside Africa are among gay and bisexual men.

Mexican health authorities have avoided emphasizing the risks to this group.

""They don't want to create stigma, but if they don't talk about it, the policies aren't going to be focused on us,"" said Baruch.

Microbiologist Natalia Pasternak also expressed concern about Brazil's messaging.

""There hasn't been an effort from the federal government to raise awareness in the population as to how you can get monkeypox, how it transmits from person to person, how you recognize the lesions in the skin and how it can transmit by close or sexual contact,"" Pasternak said.

BIDEN ADMIN MIGHT SOON DECLARE MONKEYPOX A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY: REPORT

On July 25, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said Brazil's government had ""done its homework"" to prepare, pointing to four labs doing testing.

But ""it will take some time to build testing capacity in Brazil,"" said Pasternak, a member of Sao Paulo state's monkeypox advisory board. ""We don't really see the intention of the health ministry to do this planning.""

In one possible sign of progress, PAHO said July 27 that ten countries in the region had expressed interest in acquiring a vaccine.

Dr. Andrea Vicari, PAHO's director of infectious threat management said it was not too late to curb monkeypox's spread in the Americas.

""Even if we don't have vaccines, we have other control measures. If we implement these well, we will be able to accomplish our objectives to reduce transmission."""

Monkeypox Cases in Brazil

As of Friday, Brazil reported at least 1,073 monkeypox cases in 15 states and the Federal District. The state of Sao Paolo is known to be the worst impacted by the monkeypox virus, with 818 confirmed cases, including three teenagers between 13 and 14 years old who tested positive on Thursday.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) noted that Brazil was among the countries most affected by monkeypox in the Americas.

Reuters reported that more than 98% of the confirmed cases in the South American country are men who have sex with men. According to data from the ministry, the average age of the victims is 33 years old.

Although most cases in Brazil are men, PAHO warned that the disease can still be contracted regardless of gender. On Thursday, Brazil's Health Ministry said they will open an emergency operation center to monitor the cases of monkeypox in their country.

""The immunization schedule must be two doses with an interval of 30 days between them,"" said Health Ministry Secretary Arnaldo Medeiros, adding they are negotiating with the manufacturers to acquire immunizers against the virus.

Global Health Emergency for Monkeypox Declared

Last week, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared monkeypox a global health emergency.

Ghebreyesus announced it after the U.N. health agency's expert committee could not agree on whether to apply the highest level of alert to the virus.

A global health emergency designation may help encourage more investment into combating a disease amid a scarcity of vaccines. It is the WHO's highest level of alert, but it does not mean that the disease is highly transmissible or lethal.

The same alert level was also issued for the Zika virus in 2016 in Latin America and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014.

It is important to learn from the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vizzotti stressed

Argentine Health Minister Carla Vizzotti convened a meeting with “experts” to generate “strategies to strengthen epidemiological surveillance, work together with the jurisdictions to decentralize diagnosis, train health teams and generate information actions for society.”

With the malady already declared an international emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), the idea of this meeting is to analyze the current situation, to think together about different types of strategies and to listen to concrete recommendations based on scientific evidence and our epidemiological situation, said Vizzotti through a statement.

Vizzotti insisted on capitalizing on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic that helped the strengthening of laboratories.

It is necessary to work with ANLIS-Malbrán [Institute] and the different jurisdictions to carry out training in everything related to diagnosis and laboratory, with the aim of decentralizing these tasks gradually and in a timely manner, she added.

The minister also considered it of the utmost importance that healthcare practitioners take samples of all suspected cases and make arrangements for the clinical management and the isolation of patients.

We have to work together with civil society and the community to disseminate information about this disease with clear language, especially about prevention measures, Vizzotti stressed.

By July 27, a total of 24 cases had been reported nationwide, of which 13 were in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, 6 in the province of Buenos Aires, 3 in Córdoba, 1 in Mendoza, and 1 in Santa Fe, with 100% of cases corresponding to male patients aged between 47 and 24 years."

THE Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has urged countries in the region to remain vigilant in light of monkeypox being declared a global health emergency.

Nearly 5,300 monkeypox cases have been confirmed across 18 countries and territories in the Americas, with the majority in the United States, Canada and Brazil.

To date, no deaths from monkeypox have been reported in our region, according to PAHO.

During a virtual press briefing, Dr Ciro Ugarte, director of health emergencies, highlighted one of the most important aspects of PAHO’s response is to support member states such as The Bahamas by exchanging updated and detailed information on what is happening at the global and regional level.

Dr Ugarte explained PAHO has developed and shared alerts and updates, trained laboratory technicians from all member states from the Americas on diagnostic and has also provided laboratory supplies.

This comes after Health and Wellness Minister Dr Michael Darville revealed on Tuesday his ministry was working very closely with PAHO to devise the necessary strategy in regard to monkeypox.

Currently, there are no suspected cases of the virus in country.

Dr Darville said the ministry is in negotiations with PAHO for the acquisition of monkeypox vaccines, adding the doses, once acquired, will be administered to high-risk individuals.

Dr Ugarte added: “I would like to highlight that this week 41 countries, 32 from the Americas are meeting in Brasilia to analyse which are the best approaches on surveillance alert and response to pandemics. One of the areas they will discuss this Friday specifically is how we align our response on monkeypox on the detection, diagnostic, clinical management, vaccination also, of course, the public health measures that are clearly one of the best approaches that we will have to implement on this outbreak.”

Meanwhile, PAHO deputy director Dr Mary Lou Valdez said nearly all cases continue to be reported among men who have sex with men between the ages of 25 and 45 years. She was speaking on behalf of director Dr Carissa Etienne, who was absent during Wednesday’s briefing.

She noted: “However, we should be clear that anyone regardless of their gender or sexual orientation can get monkeypox. The pattern of transmission offers a unique opportunity for countries to work closely with affected communities to ensure people know how to protect themselves and what to do if they exhibit symptoms.

“We are also working with civil society and LGBTQ+ communities to alert at-risk groups about monkeypox symptoms and to provide information about how they can protect themselves.”

During the virtual briefing, officials were asked whether it was necessary for countries to launch mass vaccination campaigns given monkeypox was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

PAHO’s head of infectious disease threats responded that at this point, officials did not recommend for countries to do so, saying the risk for the general population is very low at this point in time.

Symptoms of monkeypox include skin rash, fever, headache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion and can last up to two to four weeks.

Anyone with suspected symptoms of monkeypox is asked to call their health care provider or the nearest public health community clinic.

Additionally, PAHO’s deputy director acknowledged that a vaccine-derived polio type 2 case was reported in the United States. Local health authorities are investigating the case and PAHO will share further information as it becomes available.

Dr Valdez said: “Today, the regional polio vaccination rate is at 79% well below the recommended 95% threshold and the lowest coverage reported since 1994.This is extremely worrisome, because without adequate vaccination coverage, our region remains vulnerable to outbreaks. That’s why I want to leave you today with a reminder that we cannot afford to be complacent.”"

The secretariat also added that the National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (CONAVE, in Spanish) -made up of health sector institutions- issued the new notice so that medical, hospital surveillance and lab units report possible suspects.

CONAVE reported that, as of July 23, Mexico registered a total of 60 confirmed cases in 11 separate states; the most complicated one is Mexico City (35) and Jalisco (12).

Incubation period for monkeypox is from 5 to 21 days, and the symptomatic disease occurs in two clinical phases that are generally self-limiting from two to four weeks.

All suspects must not travel, national and international, until it is determined they are not a risk to public health.

The health secretariat also recommends constant hand-washing with soap and water or alcohol, nose and mouth covering as sneezing or coughing, sharing no food, drinks, cutlery or dishes, wearing masks, among others.

In the decades that followed human cases of monkeypox were reported in 11 African countries: Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. The first case outside Africa took place in 2003, in the United States, and was linked to human contact with infected pet prairie dogs.

According to WHO, Animal-to-human (zoonotic) transmission can occur from direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals. In Africa, evidence of monkeypox virus infection has been found in many animals including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, different species of monkeys and others. The natural reservoir of monkeypox has not yet been identified, though rodents are the most likely. Eating inadequately cooked meat and other animal products of infected animals is a possible risk factor. People living in or near forested areas may have indirect or low-level exposure to infected animals.

“Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with respiratory secretions, skin lesions of an infected person or recently contaminated objects. Transmission via droplet respiratory particles usually requires prolonged face-to-face contact, which puts health workers, household members and other close contacts of active cases at greater risk,” warned the global health authority.

With less than two weeks before the current government of President Iván Duque hands over power to the new administration of President-elect Gustavo Petro, outgoing Health Minister Fernando Ruíz emphasized that monkeypox is a disease that has been circulating in the world for more than 50 years, and has a relatively low-rate of contagion. “Monkeypox does not represent a threat of the dimension of COVID-19, but there is evidence from several countries in Europe there is also community transmission,” he added. From the 11 confirmed cases in the country, 10 originated outside the country.

“Right now we are in a phase of containment, which represents a very important opportunity for the country,” stated Ruíz. Likewise, the Minister pointed out that since last May 30, along with the National Institute of Health (INS), the country’s health professionals have intensified surveillance of the virus through PCR testing. “Colombians can be calm because there is sufficient capacity to make a diagnosis,” he confirmed. In the case of a positive result for monkeypox, self-isolation is estimated at 21 days given that this virus has a long incubation period.

There are nearly 3,000 cases of the disease in the United States, confirmed the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The Biden administration may consider declaring monkeypox a national health emergency, and increase testing for the virus."

But what's the deal with PHEICs — who decides, what does it mean, and what happens next?

Tedros: monkeypox ""a public health emergency of international concern"" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday declared the ongoing worldwide monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghrebeyesus announced.

Tedros made the declaration despite a lack of consensus among members of the WHO's emergency committee on the monkeypox outbreak. It's the first time a leader of a UN health agency has made such a decision.

What did Tedros say?

""We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,'' Tedros said.

""I know this has not been an easy or straightforward process and that there are divergent views among the members"" of the committee,"" he added.

""Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners,"" Tedros went on. ""That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.""

How has the outbreak spread?

The current outbreak started in May, with 20 cases recorded in Britain on May 20, mostly among gay men.

Since then, the outbreak has grown to almost 16,000 cases in 75 countries, Tedros said. Data from the CDC in the US indicate that in one day alone, from July 19 to July 20, confirmed case numbers leaped from 14,511 to 15,378. The current outbreak is centered in Europe.

Since July 14, Bermuda, Thailand, Serbia, Georgia, India and Saudi Arabia have all reported their first cases, adding to the now 73 countries where the current outbreak has been detected.

As the outbreak continues to grow, epidemiologists are split as to whether the WHO's decision was correct. The meeting was the second time the emergency committee convened, after a meeting on June 23 when it decided the outbreak had not met that threshold.

""It is a tricky decision for the committee,"" said Dr. Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

""In some senses, it meets the definition — it is an unprecedented outbreak widespread in many countries and would benefit from increased international coordination.

""On the other hand, it seems to be an infection for which we have the necessary tools for control; most cases are mild and the mortality rate is extremely low,"" Whitworth told DW.

What is a PHEIC?

The designation of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern is the WHO's highest alert level. It is based on international health regulations established in 2005, to define countries' rights and obligations in handling cross-border public health occurrences.

The WHO defines a PHEIC as ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.""

The WHO further explains how this definition implies a situation that is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond an affected country's border and may require immediate international action.

Who decides about a PHEIC?

The WHO's emergency committee on monkeypox provided WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus with advice on the disease but couldn't come to a consensus.

The WHO's emergency committee on monkeypox is composed of 16 members and chaired by Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele from the Democratic Republic of Congo, a former director of vaccines and immunization at the agency.

Other committee members include epidemiologists and disease experts from all around the world.

What are advantages and criticisms of PHEICs?

The purpose of a PHEIC is to focus attention on acute health risks that have the potential to spread internationally and threaten people around the world.

They are intended to help in mobilizing and coordinating information and resources, both nationally and internationally, for the purposes of prevention and response.

In practice, declaring PHEICs may end up causing a financial burden to the country facing the epidemic, particularly if travel and trade are curtailed. Indeed, some countries are reluctant to share public health data in the case of an outbreak for fear of such measures.

Critics of the PHEIC system note that an emergency is only declared when an event has started to spread internationally, indicating it has already reached an acute level. Some have called for various, intermediate stages of alarm.

In the case of COVID-19, for example, a PHEIC was only declared at the end of January 2020, after two meetings earlier in the month had decided against such a move, and several weeks after Beijing had adopted containment measures.

Researchers have found that too many countries take a ""wait and see"" approach with such declarations, ignoring them until it is too late — as with COVID-19.

""People weren't listening,"" said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan on the second anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. ""We were ringing the bell and people weren't acting.""

Such declarations are subject to too much political pressure, argue some. Others offer the criticism that emergency committee rationale has tended to be opaque or contradictory.

What PHEICs have there been in the past?

Until now, the WHO had declared a PHEIC six times, all for viral outbreaks:

January 2020 for COVID-19, declared when the virus was first detected outside of China. This eventually became a persistent global pandemic

July 2019 for Ebola, for the second time, relating to the outbreak in eastern DRC

February 2016 for Zika, which began in Brazil and affected mostly Latin America

August 2014 for Ebola, for an outbreak in West Africa that also spread to Europe and the US

May 2014 for polio, following a rise in the spread of ""wild polio"" and vaccine-derived virus in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Besides the one for COVID-19, this is the only PHEIC still in place.

2009 for the H1N1 or ""swine flu,"" which started in Mexico and spread across the world

Three outbreaks have been considered but not declared a PHEIC. These include the deadly MERS outbreak first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2013.

What happens next?

The ""WHO will continue to do everything we can to support countries to stop transmission and save lives,"" Tedros said at a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.

Testing and vaccination are sharp tools in the fight against monkeypox, although Tedros also said information was key. First and foremost, public health officials need to engage constructively with at-risk communities, experts say.

Some experts have sounded the alarm for a potential pandemic based on the recent large jump in case numbers.

""From what is known, we think it is unlikely to spread far in the general population,"" said public health professor Whitworth. ""For these reasons, I do not think this will become a generalized epidemic.""

It is the seventh time such a declaration has been made since 2009, the most recent being for Covid-19, which was given the same label by the WHO in 2020, and follows a meeting of a committee of experts on Thursday.

A public health emergency of international concern – or PHEIC – is defined by the WHO’s international health regulations as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”.

The UN health agency said the term implies the situation is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected, that it carries implications for public health beyond national borders, and that it may require immediate international attention.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said at a press conference that the committee met on Thursday to review the latest data, but that they were unable to reach a consensus. However, he has since decided to break the deadlock by declaring a PHEIC.

“In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations,” he said. “For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.”

While he said the risk of monkeypox was “moderate” globally, it was “high” in Europe and there was “a clear risk of further international spread”.

Globally, there have so far been 16,016 monkeypox cases – 4,132 of which were in the past week, according to WHO data. It is now in 75 countries and territories and there have been five deaths.

The European region has the highest number of total cases, at 11,865, and the highest increase in the last seven days, with 2,705.

Dr Rosamund Lewis, the technical lead for monkeypox at the WHO health emergencies programme, said: “There’s a lot of work to be done.”

She said action must be taken to establish what causes risk and to reduce situations that could put people at risk so they can protect themselves. “This is how we will get to the end of this outbreak,” she said.

Monkeypox is a viral infection typically found in animals in central and western Africa, although it can cause outbreaks in humans. Cases are occasionally identified in countries where the virus is not endemic, but the latest outbreak has been unprecedented.

While countries in Europe have been hardest hit, cases have also been reported in the US, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil and Mexico among others.

The WHO said the outbreak was largely among men who have sex with men who had reported having sex recently with new or multiple partners. However, experts have stressed that anyone can get monkeypox as it is spread by close or intimate contact, with the UN having warned that some media portrayals of Africans and LGBTQ+ people “reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma”.

Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO emergencies programme, said: “We all know how difficult it has been historically to deal with issues like this because of stigma.”

“If nothing else this is about enlightened self-interest,” he added, as well as “solidarity” with those affected."

Malta’s first monkeypox case had been registered on 28 May 2022 and the total number of cases as of 21 July stood at 17, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Public Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci recently said that the cases seen in Europe were self-limiting, with minor rashes and requiring no hospital admission.

“This is not another Covid, let’s make that clear. It’s important that precautions are taken when one has multiple sexual partners, as this leads to a potential exposure of this disease,” Gauci said.

Symptoms include fever, chills, headache swollen glands, muscle aches, back pain and low energy. This is typically followed by a rash, that breaks out within one to three days.

According to Ghebreyesus, there are 16,000 active cases in 75 countries and territories. Five people have died from the disease so far.

While countries in Europe have been hardest hit, cases have also been reported in the USA, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil and Mexico.

This is the seventh public health emergency declaration made by the WHO since 2009, with the most recent being COVID-19.

The WHO said that the outbreak was dominant amongst men who had sexual relationships with men who had recently had sex with new or multiple partners. Experts have however stated that anyone can get monkeypox, as it is spread by close or intimate contact."

The monkeypox virus has spread quickly in clusters across the United States — at certain music festivals, pool parties and bathhouses — and now public health officials in areas with a lot of infections want more vaccines made available to help control transmission, which appears to happen when people touch intimately, skin to skin.

“There are two different aspects of this response,” Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN.

“One is heavily concentrated, rather narrowly, on events that occur that can be the hotbeds for the spread,” Freeman said, including large dance parties and pool parties.

“Coming off of Pride Month, for example, our health departments in certain areas of the country really had their hands full because there were large events being held where people had many anonymous partners and there was no ability to even track how or when they were exposed,” Freeman said.

Second, “we’re certainly right now in a phase where we’re having to manage the existing quantity of vaccine and really focus on new cases in high-risk individuals,” she added. “So, not doing prevention efforts just quite yet — but focused on case counts.”

Those case counts are on the rise. The number of probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in the United States more than doubled within a single week, jumping from 866 to 1,814 between July 11 and 16.

The latest count from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than 2,000 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases have been reported nationwide.

Having more vaccine doses available to cities and counties across the country — especially those with rising cases — could help slow the spread of the virus, Freeman said.

Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact, and in the current outbreak, the virus has mostly been spreading among men who have sex with men.

The CDC estimates that more than 1.5 million men who have sex with men are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine in the United States.

As of Tuesday, more than 190,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine — a two-dose regimen manufactured by Bavarian Nordic for the prevention of monkeypox and smallpox — have been pulled from the Strategic National Stockpile to support local monkeypox response efforts, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

But some local health officials tell CNN that hasn’t been enough to meet demand.

‘The numbers are obviously getting larger’

For health officials in Dallas County, Texas, the summer started with a monkeypox investigation.

In early June, the state identified its first monkeypox case as part of the global outbreak of the rare disease. The patient was a Dallas County resident who had recently traveled to Mexico.

Separately, in the days that followed, two more monkeypox cases were identified in Dallas County residents who had recently traveled to Spain and Mexico.

Still, the number of cases in Dallas County remained at only about a handful — all of whom reported a history of international travel and identified themselves as men who have sex with men.

But about a month later, the county’s case count surged.

“Our first cases were overseas-travel-related, and then now we’ve had local events,” Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told CNN on Wednesday at the conference of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

“We’re trying to control and contain it, but the numbers are obviously getting larger,” he said.

Over the Fourth of July weekend, health officials identified a confirmed case of monkeypox in someone visiting for the Daddyland Festival, a four-day circuit of dance parties with live DJs, nightclub events and pool parties.

The person reported attending festival events and private parties while contagious, according to Dallas County Health and Human Services, which added that “there is a concern for local, community transmission for anyone who attended these events and participated in activities that pose a high risk for monkeypox transmission.”

At the Daddyland Festival, “thousands of people, largely men who have sex with men, were attending from around the country and around the state. They were coming to party, and that party had a lot of close contact,” Huang said.

Around that time, county health officials were notified of an out-of-state visitor with confirmed monkeypox who reported multiple sexual encounters in the sauna of the private men’s club Club Dallas between June 22 and 25. The person self-identified as a man who has sex with men.

“It’s not predisposed to men who have sex with men,” Huang said. “But there are circumstances and events that have made it so that that’s where we’re seeing most of the cases and transmission.”

As of Friday, 29 monkeypox cases have been confirmed in Dallas County residents, and health officials have released public notices about potential exposure at the Daddyland Festival and Club Dallas. Most of the affected people have had swollen lymph nodes and lesions or pustules on the skin that are characteristic of monkeypox, Huang said.

“It would be really important for people who’ve attended these to be responsible, to monitor themselves if they attended these events, and if they’re in that group, maybe to hold off participating in these events for now until this is resolved,” Huang told CNN.

Across the state of Texas, 81 probable or confirmed cases have been reported, according to CDC data.

“For the general population, unless you’re attending these sorts of events or with people that have attended these and in close contact, then the risk is very low,” Huang said. “If you go to the event and there’s a bunch of people who’ve been at it, then you have a higher risk.”

‘The sex and the stigma’

Public health officials emphasize that anyone who comes into contact with a person who has an active monkeypox infection can be at risk of becoming infected with the virus — no matter their sexual orientation — and that the disease should not be stigmatized.

“Anything that has stigma, people are not going to want to report,” Patrick McGough, executive director of the Oklahoma City-County Health Department, told CNN at the public health conference Wednesday. His state has a total of three probable or confirmed monkeypox cases, according to CDC data.

There remains some concern more people could be infected with monkeypox but are not getting tested. Those cases then can go unreported.

“There’s the anonymous nature of a lot of the sex and the stigma,” Freeman said.

“There is also the education around monkeypox in general: Not everybody understands what it is or how you get it,” she said. “At the community level, we have a lot of work to do with health education and promoting testing.”

For instance, “in California, we’re hearing that bathhouses continue to be an area that they’re focusing health education efforts on since those particularly focus on men having sex with other men, with many several anonymous partners, in one setting,” Freeman said.

But as more people get tested, more cases could be identified, and “we’ll find out more about how widespread it is.”

Additionally, it remains unclear whether the virus is spreading mostly through sexual transmission or through other forms of skin-to-skin contact.

“We’re really trying to understand what skin-to-skin contact means and how long it takes to transmit,” McGough said. “It seems to be cluster events where there’s a lot of skin-to-skin or sexual contact, but it’s not a sexually exclusive disease, nor is it limited to one group like men who have sex with men.”

Kissing, intercourse or just rubbing are all examples of ways in which the virus appears to be spreading, based on contact tracing investigations, McGough said, and “it stands to reason” that the spread happens when the infected person has a rash or pustules on the skin.

‘Vaccine availability right now is still limited’

Local health departments across the United States are learning more about how the monkeypox virus is spreading through contact tracing, the practice of identifying and interviewing the contacts of people who test positive.

Additionally, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced last month that monkeypox testing would expand to five commercial labs: Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare.

Testing for the monkeypox virus “hasn’t really been a major limitation in Dallas County thus far,” nor has the timeline of turning results, according to Huang. But he said there can definitely be room for improvement in vaccination.

“There’s still not available vaccine,” Huang said, at least outside of the nation’s biggest cities.

“Vaccine availability right now is still limited,” he said. “Texas wasn’t one of the high-priority communities like New York, LA and Chicago initially who got larger amounts of vaccine.”

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has announced that beginning Wednesday, monkeypox vaccine will be available for men who have sex with men and for transgender persons who either have been diagnosed with gonorrhea or syphilis in the past year, are on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, or have attended or worked at a venue in the past 21 days where they had anonymous sex or sex with multiple partners, such as saunas, bathhouses or sex parties.

LA County received an additional 9,000 Jynneos vaccine doses last week and expects another 7,000 this week.

Meanwhile, Dallas County health officials have had to restrict vaccinations to “persons with actual close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has tested and confirmed positive,” Huang said. With more vaccine supply, “we’d be able to open it up to more persons who are of higher risk, or attended an event.”

He added that in just over 100 doses have been administered in his county.

The financial burden of monkeypox

Besides the need for more vaccines, there could be added costs for local health departments, McGough said.

In Dallas County, “we’re looking at getting additional manpower to assist with doing some of the monitoring. We monitor people who have been exposed for about 21 days after the exposure for symptoms,” Huang said. “But if we can get more vaccine, then we can start being able to administer that broader to higher-risk people. It’s seeming like it’s going to take some time.”

In Oklahoma City, where McGough is based, the health department helps monkeypox patients isolate by providing meals and other resources if needed, and staff check on infected patients to monitor their symptoms and care for their potential health needs.

If monkeypox cases rise, “that’s going to be quite a financial burden,” McGough said. “We have to prepare for it if that happens.”

So far this year, about 10,800 monkeypox cases have been detected in places where the virus does not typically spread, such as the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Both the global case count and US case count include laboratory-confirmed monkeypox cases and infections attributed to an Orthopoxvirus, the genus of viruses that includes monkeypox; smallpox, which has been eradicated; and the related cowpox and camelpox viruses, which very rarely jump to humans.

The outbreak is being driven by a group of monkeypox viruses known as the West African clade, according to the CDC.

This lineage of viruses rarely causes severe or fatal disease, but children younger than 8, people with weakened immune systems or a history of eczema, and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding face a greater risk of such outcomes.

In late June, the CDC and US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they'd begun ramping up the nation's capacity for monkeypox testing by supplying tests to five commercial laboratory companies.

""Health care providers will be able to use these laboratories by early July and testing capacity through these companies will be ramped up throughout the month,"" the HHS said.

However, since the first US cases were detected in May, monkeypox testing has generally been hard to come by, so the CDC's official case count is likely misleading, Keletso Makofane, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told NPR.

That's partially because health care providers previously had to go through a cumbersome process to procure tests, and partially because many providers were only supplying tests to patients whose condition matched a narrow definition of what monkeypox looks like.

Monkeypox Symptoms

With this in mind, the CDC recently updated its guidance as to who should be tested for monkeypox based on their symptoms, Live Science previously reported. In this health alert, the agency noted that many of the recent monkeypox cases in the US have not matched classical descriptions of the disease.

Normally, monkeypox infections are thought to start with flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue.

Then, the characteristic ""pox"" rashes begin to appear, usually around the face and in the oral cavity, and later, on the extremities, including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

These rashes progress through several stages, starting out as discolored patches of skin and then forming into raised bumps, blisters, and large, pus-filled pimples that eventually scab over and fall off. In most cases, these symptoms resolve in two to four weeks.

In the current outbreak, however, some patient's symptoms have diverged from the normal pattern. For example, some patients developed flu-like symptoms after their skin rashes or didn't experience flu-like symptoms at all, the CDC reported.

Some patients initially developed rashes around the genitals and anus, and these skin lesions caused symptoms of painful inflammation and rectal bleeding. And sometimes, patients have had rashes in different stages of progression at the same body site, which is unusual.

Monkeypox rashes can be mistaken for rashes caused by Varicella zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox; or for certain sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and herpes, so patients suspected to have these diseases should also be tested for monkeypox, the CDC noted.

How Monkeypox Spreads

Monkeypox spreads when people come into contact with an infected person's rashes or materials contaminated with their bodily fluids, such as clothing or linens, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Transmission can also occur through respiratory droplets, meaning spit and mucus, but this mode of transmission usually requires ""prolonged"" face-to-face contact. In pregnant people, the virus can pass through the placenta and can also be transmitted via close contact to newborns during and after birth.

Preliminary research suggests that the monkeypox viruses driving the current outbreak have a reproduction number, or R-naught (R0), of 0.8, the WHO reported. That means that a single infected person infects 0.8 more people, on average.

That said, the virus's R0 may be greater than 1 among men who have sex with men, as so far, the majority of confirmed cases have been detected in this group. That's not because monkeypox is a sexually transmitted disease or more likely to infect men who have sex with men, but rather because the virus happens to be spreading within this social network.

Monkeypox Treatments and Vaccines in the US

There are no drugs specifically approved to treat monkeypox, and many people recover without the need for specific treatment.

However, in severe cases, patients may receive antiviral medications intended to treat other infections; for example, they may receive tecovirimat (brand name TPOXX), which is designed to treat smallpox and also works against other orthopoxviruses, according to the CDC.

Severe monkeypox infections may be also treated with Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (VIGIV), which contains antibodies taken from the blood of people who were immunized with the smallpox vaccine.

People who have recently been exposed to monkeypox may also be given one of two vaccines – JYNNEOS or ACAM2000 – to reduce the severity of their symptoms or to prevent the illness altogether, according to the CDC.

JYNNEOS, approved for both monkeypox and smallpox, is a newer vaccine and generally preferred over ACAM2000, which carries a risk of severe side effects in immunocompromised people, pregnant people and older adults, The New York Times reported.

On June 28, the CDC and the HHS launched a campaign to expand vaccine access during the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.

All people with confirmed or presumed monkeypox exposures are now eligible for free vaccination, including those ""who had close physical contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading,"" the statement reads.

However, the vaccination plan's rollout has not been smooth so far.

Upon the plan's announcement, experts criticized the rollout as too slow and too limited in scale, The New York Times reported.

Already, health and city officials in San Francisco have requested that the federal government quickly distribute more vaccine doses, arguing that the current need vastly outstrips the supply, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

Similarly, in New York City, vaccine appointments have been filling as quickly as they're released, and Mayor Eric Adams recently wrote to President Joe Biden to ask for more doses to distribute, Gothamist reported.

Meanwhile, two states with confirmed monkeypox cases – New Mexico and South Dakota – have yet to receive any vaccine doses, CNN reported Thursday (June 14).

New Mexico has confirmed its first ""probable case"" of monkeypox, the state Department of Health announced Monday.

An unidentified patient who had recently traveled out of state underwent testing Friday and a subsequent test to confirm the positive result was underway at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the department said. The patient, meanwhile, is isolating at home and ""doing well,"" according to a news release.

An international outbreak of moneypox, a viral illness, had risen to 8,238 cases in 57 countries as of Monday, per the CDC. The United States has seen hundreds of cases across more than 30 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

Symptoms of the illness include fever, head and muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that may resemble pimples or blisters. Most cases recover but approximately one in 10 cases proves fatal, the World Health Organization has said.

It can be spread through contact with a person who has the disease or clothing or bedding used by an infected person. The CDC said early data suggested sexual contact has been a significant factor in the recent spread. Kissing or other contact with bodily fluids can transmit the disease. Monkeypox can also be contracted, health officials say, through contact with a wild animal, living or dead, that is unique to Africa — or even from using a product derived from those animals.

The New Mexico Department of Health advised Monday that symptoms typically begin within 21 days of exposure and last two to four weeks. The advice upon testing positive is to isolate at home until scabs have fallen off and fresh skin has formed over the sites. Vaccines against the disease are available and recommended by the CDC for anyone who has been exposed.

The DOH said anyone exhibiting symptoms should isolate themselves from others and contact their healthcare provider for monkeypox testing. Public health offices can assist those without a provider or health insurance, and can be looked up online at www.nmhealth.org/location/public/.

Because the symptoms can often resemble those of syphilis, which is far more common than monkeypox, the state also recommended free testing for sexually transmitted diseases via www.nmstdtest.org.

The department did not state whether the New Mexico resident who tested positive had been in contact with others since returning from their travel or if there was evidence for further community spread.

Acting state Health Secretary David Scrase said in a news release that monkeypox is rare and ""does not spread as easily among people,"" but warned nonetheless that ""anyone who has close contact with someone with monkeypox is at risk of infection, which makes this a public health concern for all of us.""

Rio's new patient was a man from London

Rio de Janeiro state officials Wednesday confirmed the fifth local case of monkeypox, while four others are still under investigation, it was reported.

According to a statement from the State Health Secretariat, three of the confirmed patients reside in the city of Rio and one in Maricá (in the Great Rio). The fifth case is a resident of London who was traveling to Rio when the disease was confirmed.

Wednesday's case included, there are 21 confirmed patients with monkeypox in Brazil, 14 of them in São Paulo and two in Rio Grande do Sul, besides the ones registered in Rio. According to the federal Ministry of Health, another 23 cases are under investigation in the states of Ceará, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, Santa Catarina, Espírito Santo, Acre, Rio Grande do Norte, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio, besides the Federal District.

Meanwhile, national health authorities insisted that all vaccines offered by the Single Health System (SUS) were tested, approved, and safe; and that false news lead many people to death. Based on these principles, the campaign to encourage vaccination Vaccine Plus was launched Wednesday in Brasilia with the endorsement of the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO and WHO) in partnership with national, state, and municipal health councils.

We are working to undo false news that lead to death, said the National Health Council (CNS) Chairman Fernando Pigatto during the launching ceremony of the new campaign, which also has the partnerships of the National Council of Health Secretaries (Conass) and Council of Municipal Health Secretaries (Conasems).

According to the CNS, Brazil is one of the few countries that offer an extensive list of free vaccines to its population, with a National Immunization Program (PNI) that annually provides about 300 million vaccines against more than 30 diseases in approximately 38 thousand vaccination rooms throughout the country.

The National Health Council reaffirmed that vaccination is one of the most effective, cost-effective, and life-saving public health interventions. The goal of the campaign is to join efforts to make the population of Brazil aware of the importance of increasing vaccination coverage.

According to PAHO's representative in Brazil, Socorro Gross, the campaign draws attention to the need for people to get vaccinated more than they are doing today.

It also shows that this 'More' - used in the campaign - symbolizes the sum of efforts we need to achieve the increase in vaccination coverage to have healthier people, she added while pointing out that the campaign also highlights that vaccines are available for free through the great SUS in all Brazilian states and municipalities so that people make use of this right, which also involves responsibilities.

According to Gross, vaccines are one of the most effective public health measures, and it is, therefore, necessary that they remain a global public good that cannot be taken away from the population because they keep everyone healthy, helping us to eliminate diseases. Vaccines save lives, are safe and prevent disease, and protect the most vulnerable communities, she also explained.

The CNS recalls that thanks to vaccines, smallpox was eradicated from the world in 1980. ”And the Americas region was the first on the planet to eliminate diseases such as polio (in 1994), rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (in 2015), and neonatal tetanus (in 2017), she underscored.

However, according to Pigatto, the high vaccination coverage rate has been falling in recent years, leaving millions of people at risk.

According to the Health Ministry, between 2015 and 2021 the number of children vaccinated with the first dose against polio fell from 3,121,912 to 2,089,643.

For the CNS, insufficient immunization also resulted in the return of measles to Brazil. The country had been free of autochthonous transmission [which occurs within the national territory] of the virus causing this disease in 2016. However, the combination of imported cases of measles and low vaccination coverage led Brazil to have an outbreak, which, since 2018, has taken the lives of 40 people, mainly children, he stressed.

Through the Vaccine Plus” campaign, the council intends to motivate the population to expand the use of this type of immunization, taking relevant information about the safety, importance, and effectiveness of all vaccines made available by the Unified Health System (SUS) in the National Vaccination Calendar to different audiences.

In his speech, acting Health Minister Daniel Pereira highlighted that thanks to the joint effort involving the health authorities at the federal, state, and municipal levels, it was possible to distribute more than 500 million doses of vaccines to fight the pandemic.

Every Brazilian who wanted to be vaccinated had a vaccine available to them wherever they went. The vaccine is what allowed us to reach, today, a much more tranquil scenario than in the past when there was a lack of beds in hospitals in the country, said Pereira. But ... the pandemic is [still] here and we have to be alert.

The Biden-Harris administration described the vaccine strategy as its ""first phase,"" in their announcement published by the White House, according to New York Post.

The administration went on to say that the plans unveiled on Tuesday are a ""critical part"" of its monkeypox outbreak response.

""The strategy aims to mitigate the spread of the virus in communities where transmission has been the highest and with populations most at risk,"" the announcement read, adding that the plan would distribute two-dose JYNNEOS vaccine and FDA-approved protection against smallpox and monkeypox.

The said remedies are intended for individuals 18 years and older.

Pres. Joe Biden Administration Monkeypox Vaccine Strategy

According to the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. ""has effective vaccines and treatments that can be used against monkeypox.""

The announcement underscored that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) received at least 9,000 doses of vaccines and 300 courses of antiviral smallpox treatments.

The vaccine strategy unveiled by President Joe Biden, and his administration, will also expand the deployment of vaccines across the U.S. The administration would allocate 296,000 doses over the coming weeks.

At least 56,000 of that number will be allocated immediately. At least 16 million additional doses will be available over the coming months.

Meanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the Post, through a phone call, that at least 800,000 doses will be imported in July and early August, with an additional 500,000 doses which were recently contracted for.

The monkeypox vaccine strategy would also make testing for the disease more accessible.

""The CDC has since scaled testing capacity to 78 sites in 48 states, primarily at state public health laboratories, with spare capacity to conduct nearly 10,000 tests per week nationwide,"" the announcement underscored.

Centers for Disease Controls and Preventions (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said that doctors should increase testing for the virus.

""I strongly encourage all healthcare providers to have a high clinical suspicion for monkeypox among their patients,"" Walensky said, adding that patients with a suspicious rash should be tested for the disease.

Monkeypox is a virus that can spread through close intimate contact. Its known symptoms are rash and fever.

Monkeypox is less transmissible than fast-spreading respiratory diseases. Early cases of monkeypox in the U.S. and Western Europe are linked to sexual contact among gay men who attended large events.

California Has the Highest Case of Monkeypox in the U.S.

On Tuesday, California became the state with the highest case of monkeypox. The Golden State recorded at least 66 monkeypox cases as of Tuesday, according to the data from CDC.

New York comes second with 63 cases, and Illinois at third with 45 cases.

All in all, the CDC noted that there are 306 cases of monkeypox/orhthopox virus across the U.S.

Even if WHO announces monkeypox is a global emergency, it is still unclear what impact that might have

Colombian health authorities Thursday confirmed the first three local cases of monkeypox had been detected. Two of the patients were also proved to have had a recent travel history to Europe.

Also Thursday, Argentina confirmed a fourth case of the malady on the same day the World Health Organization's emergency committee convened to determine whether to declare monkeypox a pandemic or not.

Two of the Colombian cases were in Bogotá and the other in Medellín, it was also reported. They were identified in Bogota with a history of travel to Europe and, after taking serum samples, exudate of lesions and pharyngeal swab, they are in isolation with contact tracing, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health.

Epidemiology and Demography Director Claudia Cuéllar called all Colombians not to panic, but to rather be alert at the possible appearance of symptoms or a suspicion of having been in close contact with a confirmed patient. In either case, ”call your EPS (Health Care Provider Entity) or go to the nearest health center,” she said.

Argentine authorities confirmed Thursday a new case of monkeypox in the country, reported (west), which adds four contagions so far.

The Argentine patient is a 45-year-old man living in the province of Mendoza who had traveled to Spain in the last 21 days and who had a fever above 38 degrees in addition to the inflammation of the lymph nodes and vesicular rashes on June 15. The case was first suspected of being monkeypox on June 19, and on June 21, samples were sent to a laboratory. At the moment, his state of health is good and he is undergoing the corresponding isolation, according to Argentine authorities.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed around 3,500 cases in 42 countries over the past six weeks, due to which an emergency committee has convened in Geneva to assess whether the outbreak of monkeypox constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. This is the highest level of alert the agency can declare, a consideration currently held by coronavirus and polio.

Such a declaration would seek to increase coordination among countries and strengthen mechanisms for the active search for cases and the implementation of measures worldwide to help curb the circulation of the virus, something that should take place in the coming weeks.

The results of the meeting are to be announced to the press Friday at noon, local time, or by Saturday morning, when a statement is also expected to be released.

The committee's meeting comes amid growing concern about the increase in cases in non-endemic areas outside Africa, especially Europe but also the Americas, with cases also in Asia and Oceania.

Spain has taken over as the country with the highest number of cases (over 800), followed by the UK (793), Germany (592), Portugal (317), France (277), Canada (245), the Netherlands (167) and the United States (156), according to figures released by WHO Thursday morning.

Several scientists have come out in favor of broadening the case definition, the criteria that a patient must meet in order to be tested to confirm or rule out that he or she is a carrier of the monkeypox virus.

A letter published in The Lancet this month warned that the current case definition would not detect the disease in a heterosexual man with the characteristic vesicles of the rash if he has not traveled [to a risk area] or is a confirmed case report.

To the untrained eye, monkeypox can easily be confused with other diagnoses with dermatological conditions such as chickenpox, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, syphilis, gonorrhea, or molluscum contagiosum, the letter went on.

Declaring monkeypox a global emergency would mean the UN health agency considers the outbreak to be an “extraordinary event” and that the disease might spread across even more borders. It would also give monkeypox the same distinction as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing effort to eradicate polio.

Last week, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the appearance of monkeypox as “unusual and concerning.” Until last month, monkeypox had not caused sizeable outbreaks beyond Africa, where it has sickened people for decades. One of the variants of monkeypox kills up to 10% of people. Africa has already seen more than 1,400 cases this year, including 62 deaths.

The vast majority of cases outside Africa have been detected in men who have sex with men, but scientists warn anyone in close contact with an infected person or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection.

Even if WHO announces monkeypox is a global emergency, it is still unclear what impact that might have. In January 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 an international emergency, but few countries took notice until March, when the organization described it as a pandemic.

According to health experts, the rash generated by monkeypox usually begins one to three days after the onset of fever. The lesions may be flat or slightly raised, filled with clear or yellowish liquid, and then they may crust over, dry up and fall off.

Symptoms also include headache, muscle or back pain, swollen glands, and fatigue, as well as skin rash, which goes through different stages until it forms a crust that then falls off.

Infected persons are contagious until all the scabs have fallen off,” according to WHO."

Doctors there told him to isolate himself. Instead, they say he fled, packed his bags and got on a flight back to the United States.

Still, Dallas County officials have confirmed a patient who traveled to Mexico was the first person to test positive for monkeypox in Texas.

""We're working with the individual, and that person is cooperating with our department, with the state and federal authorities and is in isolation. So, again, we have compliance from that individual to do what's necessary to prevent further spread of the infection,” said Dallas County Health Director Phillip Huang.

While Dallas County works with both state and federal health officials to find people who were on the patient's flight, experts said he likely won't face legal charges.

UNT Health Science Center epidemiologist Dr. Shane Fernando said there are still consequences for those who knowingly expose others.

“There should be ethical implications for this, right? If you know that you are infected with something that can hurt someone else, whether it be a cold, the flu or COVID, you must make all attempts to protect those around you,” he said.

Mexican authorities said the patient had previously traveled to Berlin and was at various celebrations during his time in Vallarta, including at Mantamar Beach.

Though they continue to look for close contacts and monitor them, they said no one else has shown symptoms.

There have been 1,200 cases of monkeypox confirmed globally and 40 nationwide.

As of Tuesday, it has now made its way to the Lone Star State. A resident of Dallas County tested positive for the virus following an international trip to Mexico. This makes Texas the 15th state to confirm positive cases of the virus.

Monkeypox Is Becoming a Bigger Concern

Now you may be thinking ""it is just one case, so why do it matter?"", but if you know a little more about the virus, it should be cause for concern. First and foremost, the Monkeypox virus is directly related to the smallpox virus, a disease that was eradicated in 1979. While the older generations are likely safe thanks to the smallpox vaccines that they received decades ago, younger portions of the population have not been administered this protection.

Secondly, this virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids. Therefore, just like the cold or flu, if someone coughs, sneezes, or wipes their nose and then touches a surface, they have potentially given this illness to another person. Even just close face-to-face contact through talking can cause spread. Did we mention that this person traveled by plane on their trip? If he was exhibiting symptoms during his travel, he could have come in contact with hundreds, if not thousands of people.

Signs & Symptoms of Monkeypox

Monkeypox is not pretty. It begins with flu-like symptoms. These include fever, body aches, chills, and swollen lymph nodes. This is followed by the formation of a very painful rash. It begins as red patches on the skin and then transitions into vesicles (fluid-filled blisters) and the pustules (pus-filled sacs).

It takes approximately two weeks to a month for a person to progress through the various stages of the rash and finally heal. They are considered contagious throughout the process. Unfortunately, just like all other viruses, once you test positive, you can only address the symptoms. There are no antibiotics to cure the illness faster. Therefore, the only thing to do is wait it out in isolation.

How Monkeypox Impacts Summer Travel

With over two-thirds of the population becoming vaccinated for COVID-19, we have seen masks slowly start to become a thing of the past. However, with Monkeypox on the rise, it is best to bring them back into style if you intend to travel this Summer. This can help to lower your risk of contact.

Moreover, it is imperative that folks be vigilant about hand washing and sanitizing surfaces. Thus, if you are planning to fly, pack the Clorox wipes and clean off your seat and tray table before use. Unfortunately, individuals with weakened immune systems, children under the age of eight, and both pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are more susceptible. Therefore, these members of the population need to be extra cautious.

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) raised their travel notice to a Level 2 Alert as of this week. What that means is that they recommend that folks practice enhanced precautions, like wearing a mask and avoiding travel to highly impacted areas, if possible. Currently, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and Canada are reporting the highest number of cases.

Most importantly, if you even suspect that you are sick, cancel your travel plans to avoid the potential spread of the illness. If COVID has taught us anything, it is that we need to hold ourselves accountable and not just think about ourselves.

While the risk is relatively low at this time, this virus is not something that you want to catch. The CDC notes that as many as 11% of Monkeypox cases are fatal and since there is no real treatment, it is best to be proactive to avoid getting sick. Updates on states impacted by Monkeypox can be found on the CDC's Situation Summary page.

136,https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/monkeypox-wont-turn-into-pandemic/,AR,"fever, rash, fatigue","airborne, close contact","WHO, World Health Organization","Monkeypox, COVID-19",Argentina,true,"LONDON, May 30, (AP): The World Health Organization’s top monkeypox expert said she doesn’t expect the hundreds of cases reported to date to turn into another pandemic, but acknowledged there are still many unknowns about the disease, including how exactly it’s spreading and whether the suspension of mass smallpox immunization decades ago may somehow be speeding its transmission. In a public session on Monday, WHO’s Dr. Rosamund Lewis said it was critical to emphasize that the vast majority of cases being seen in dozens of countries globally are in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men, so that scientists can further study the issue and for populations at risk to take precautions.

“It’s very important to describe this because it appears to be an increase in a mode of transmission that may have been under-recognized in the past,” said Lewis, WHO’s technical lead on monkeypox. Still, she warned that anyone is at potential risk of the disease, regardless of their sexual orientation. Other experts have pointed out that it may be accidental that the disease was first picked up in gay and bisexual men, saying it could quickly spill over into other groups if it is not curbed. To date, WHO said 23 countries that haven’t previously had monkeypox have reported more than 250 cases. Lewis said it’s unknown whether monkeypox is being transmitted by sex or just the close contact between people engaging in sexual activity and described the threat to the general population as “low.”

“It is not yet known whether this virus is exploiting a new mode of transmission, but what is clear is that it continues to exploit its well-known mode of transmission, which is close, physical contact,” Lewis said. Monkeypox is known to spread when there is close physical contact with an infected person or their clothing or bedsheets. She also warned that among the current cases, there is a higher proportion of people with fewer lesions that are more concentrated in the genital region and sometimes nearly impossible to see.

“You may have these lesions for two to four weeks (and) they may not be visible to others, but you may still be infectious,” she said. Last week, a top adviser to WHO said the outbreak in Europe, US, Australia and beyond was likely linked to sex at two recent raves in Spain and Belgium. That marks a significant departure from the disease’s typical pattern of spread in central and western Africa, where people are mainly infected by animals like wild rodents and primates, and epidemics haven’t spilled across borders. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak.

Contained

WHO’s Lewis also said that while previous cases of monkeypox in central and western Africa have been relatively contained, it was not clear if people could spread monkeypox without symptoms or if the disease might be airborne, like measles or COVID-19. Monkeypox is related to smallpox, but has milder symptoms. After smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, countries suspended their mass immunization programs, a move that some experts believe may be helping monkeypox spread, since there is now little widespread immunity to related diseases; smallpox vaccines are also protective against monkeypox.

Lewis said it would be “unfortunate” if monkeypox were able to “exploit the immunity gap” left by smallpox 40 years ago, saying that there was still a window of opportunity to close down the outbreak so that monkeypox would not become entrenched in new regions. Argentina reported two cases of the monkeypox virus on Friday in men who had recently arrived from Spain, marking the first time the presence of the virus has been confirmed in Latin America during this latest outbreak. Argentina’s health ministry first confirmed a man from the province of Buenos Aires who had traveled to Spain has monkeypox.

137,http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/monkeypox-wont-turn-into-pandemic/,AR,"fever, rash, fatigue","airborne, close contact","WHO, World Health Organization","Monkeypox, COVID-19",Argentina,true,"LONDON, May 30, (AP): The World Health Organization’s top monkeypox expert said she doesn’t expect the hundreds of cases reported to date to turn into another pandemic, but acknowledged there are still many unknowns about the disease, including how exactly it’s spreading and whether the suspension of mass smallpox immunization decades ago may somehow be speeding its transmission. In a public session on Monday, WHO’s Dr. Rosamund Lewis said it was critical to emphasize that the vast majority of cases being seen in dozens of countries globally are in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men, so that scientists can further study the issue and for populations at risk to take precautions.

“It’s very important to describe this because it appears to be an increase in a mode of transmission that may have been under-recognized in the past,” said Lewis, WHO’s technical lead on monkeypox. Still, she warned that anyone is at potential risk of the disease, regardless of their sexual orientation. Other experts have pointed out that it may be accidental that the disease was first picked up in gay and bisexual men, saying it could quickly spill over into other groups if it is not curbed. To date, WHO said 23 countries that haven’t previously had monkeypox have reported more than 250 cases. Lewis said it’s unknown whether monkeypox is being transmitted by sex or just the close contact between people engaging in sexual activity and described the threat to the general population as “low.”

“It is not yet known whether this virus is exploiting a new mode of transmission, but what is clear is that it continues to exploit its well-known mode of transmission, which is close, physical contact,” Lewis said. Monkeypox is known to spread when there is close physical contact with an infected person or their clothing or bedsheets. She also warned that among the current cases, there is a higher proportion of people with fewer lesions that are more concentrated in the genital region and sometimes nearly impossible to see.

“You may have these lesions for two to four weeks (and) they may not be visible to others, but you may still be infectious,” she said. Last week, a top adviser to WHO said the outbreak in Europe, US, Australia and beyond was likely linked to sex at two recent raves in Spain and Belgium. That marks a significant departure from the disease’s typical pattern of spread in central and western Africa, where people are mainly infected by animals like wild rodents and primates, and epidemics haven’t spilled across borders. Most monkeypox patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. No deaths have been reported in the current outbreak.

Contained

WHO’s Lewis also said that while previous cases of monkeypox in central and western Africa have been relatively contained, it was not clear if people could spread monkeypox without symptoms or if the disease might be airborne, like measles or COVID-19. Monkeypox is related to smallpox, but has milder symptoms. After smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, countries suspended their mass immunization programs, a move that some experts believe may be helping monkeypox spread, since there is now little widespread immunity to related diseases; smallpox vaccines are also protective against monkeypox.

Lewis said it would be “unfortunate” if monkeypox were able to “exploit the immunity gap” left by smallpox 40 years ago, saying that there was still a window of opportunity to close down the outbreak so that monkeypox would not become entrenched in new regions. Argentina reported two cases of the monkeypox virus on Friday in men who had recently arrived from Spain, marking the first time the presence of the virus has been confirmed in Latin America during this latest outbreak. Argentina’s health ministry first confirmed a man from the province of Buenos Aires who had traveled to Spain has monkeypox.

Lopez-Gatell also assured that the emergent virus has a slight infection rate and the probability of a full-blown epidemic is low.

“Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by direct contact. It is not spread by air, water, or food. The transmission efficiency is low, so there are usually isolated cases or small outbreaks, not generalized epidemics,” he said.



According to the World Health Organization, 244 cases have been reported worldwide till May 23, from which 160 were confirmed and 184 under suspicion. The WHO first reported a series of cases among 12 member states on May 13.

One case of monkeypox has been identified in the Republic of Ireland, the country’s public health authorities confirmed on Saturday.

It’s the second confirmed case on the island after neighbouring Northern Ireland confirmed its first case on Thursday.

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) said it was notified on Friday night of the case in the east of Ireland. The person was not hospitalised, the HPSC said, but it didn’t provide other information in order to maintain patient confidentiality.

The centre said a second person was awaiting test results, and those who were in contact were being provided with advice.

Monkeypox, a viral disease usually found in West or Central Africa, has appeared in around 20 countries including in Europe, the Americas, Australia, and the Middle East this month.

Since England reported its first confirmed case on May 7, around 200 confirmed cases and more than 100 suspected cases have been reported, most of them in Spain, England, and Portugal.

The HPSC said the Health Service Executive had set up a multidisciplinary Incident Management Team since the beginning of the outbreak. It also said monkeypox had been made a notifiable disease, meaning hospitals and labs are required to notify the local health authorities when they identify a case of the disease.

Northern Ireland’s Public Health Agency confirmed the UK region’s first case on Thursday, hours after a case was announced in Wales.

As of Thursday, three cases were identified in Scotland and 101 were found in England, bringing the UK total to 106.

Only the first case was reported to have had a recent travel history to Nigeria and the majority of the confirmed cases were among men who have sex with other men.

Three confirmed cases were reported in Latin America on Saturday, two in Argentina and one in Mexico.

One Argentinian case is a Spanish citizen who travelled to Argentina on Wednesday, according to the country’s Health Ministry. Mexico’s Health Secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell said the case identified is a 50-year-old male New York resident who “was probably infected in the Netherlands.”

Initial symptoms of the monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion.

A rash may develop within one to five days after the appearance of fever. It changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab which later falls off, According to the UK Health Security Agency.

An individual is contagious until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath. The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.

The disease doesn’t easily transmit among humans, but transmission can occur if one comes in contact with clothing or linens used by an infected person, monkeypox skin lesions or scabs, or the coughing or sneezing of an individual with a monkeypox rash."

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina: Argentina reported a case of the monkeypox virus on Friday in a man who recently traveled to Spain. It also reported a suspected case of the rare virus in another person.

A man from the province of Buenos Aires has monkeypox, Argentina's ministry said in a statement.

An official in the ministry earlier confirmed the positive case but said health authorities were waiting to finish sequencing the virus before making the official announcement.

It is the first time the presence of the virus has been confirmed in Latin America during this latest outbreak in countries around the world that are not usually known to have outbreaks.

The sequencing of the virus revealed a high degree of similarity with monkeypox from western Africa, as has been the case with the new infections around the world, Argentina's Health Ministry said.

Authorities have revealed little about the patient beyond saying he traveled to Spain from April 28 through May 16 and had symptoms compatible with monkeypox, including lesions and a fever, on Sunday.

The man is being treated for his symptoms. All of his close contacts are being monitored and none have presented any symptoms to date, the Health Ministry said.

Health authorities in Argentina also reported an additional suspected case of the virus in a resident of Spain who is currently visiting the province of Buenos Aires and has no ties to the first case.

The man presented lesions compatible with monkeypox on Thursday, a day after arriving in the country.

'The patient is in good general health, isolated and receiving symptomatic treatment,” the Health Ministry added. None of his close contacts have yet to present any symptoms.

Nearly 200 cases of monkeypox have recently been reported in more than 20 countries not usually known to have outbreaks of the disease, the World Health Organization said on Friday."

Factfile on the current oubreak of monkeypox as dozens of cases of the rare disease are detected in North America, Europe and the Middle East.

Monkeypox was first detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970 and is considered endemic in around a dozen African countries.

Its appearance in non-endemic countries has worried experts, although those cases reported so far have been mostly mild and there have been no deaths.

There have been at least a half-dozen confirmed or suspected cases in the US.

What is Monkeypox?

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that initially shows flu-like symptoms and later leads to rashes on the body. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health defines it as ""Monkeypox is a rare but potentially serious viral illness that typically begins with flu-like illness and swelling of the lymph nodes and progresses to a rash on the face and body. Most infections last 2-to-4 weeks. In parts of central and west Africa where monkeypox occurs, people can be exposed through bites or scratches from rodents and small mammals, preparing wild game, or having contact with an infected animal or possibly animal products.”

Monkeypox symptoms to watch out for

Fever

Headache, muscle aches, backache

Swollen lymph nodes

Exhaustion

Rashes

ICMR's warning

On May 27, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) warned that children are more at risk of being detected with the Monkeypox virus. Dr Aparna Mukherjee, ICMR scientist asked people not to panic as the virus spreads by ""very close contact"". She said symptoms including body ache, rashes, high fever, large lymph nodes should be kept a close watch on.

Global Monkeypox outbreak

More than 200 Monkeypox cases have been reported in over 20 non-endemic countries so far. Mexico on Saturday (May 28) reported its first confirmed case of monkeypox, Reuters reported. A 50-year-old permanent resident of New York is the first case in Mexico detected with the zoonotic virus.

Argentina had become the first Latin American country to report a case of Monkeypox on Friday.

The outbreaks have triggered dread as the virus which was first found in monkeys, is usually reported in West and Central Africa, and rarely spreads elsewhere.

Not Only in Argentina: WHO Says Nearly 200 Cases of Monkeypox Recorded Worldwide

The announcement that two men in Argentina were infected with the monkeypox virus came on the same day the World Health Organization (WHO) said nearly 200 cases of the disease had been reported in at least 20 countries.

These countries were not usually known to have outbreaks of the unusual disease. However, according to reports, the number seemed to be an ""undercount"" of the actual number of cases.

On Friday, Spanish authorities reported that the number of cases in their country rose to 98, including a woman whose infection was ""directly related"" to a chain of transmission previously limited to men.

Officials from the U.K. added 16 more new cases, making Britain's total 106. Portugal confirmed that its monkeypox cases were now 74.

In a public hearing held on Friday, WHO's director of pandemic and epidemic diseases, Dr. Sylvie Briand, said the first sequencing of the monkeypox virus showed that the strain is not different from those strains found in endemic countries.

According to Briand, the current situation appeared to be ""containable"" based on how past outbreaks of the disease in Africa have evolved.

""[But] we don't know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg [or] if there are many more cases that are undetected in communities,"" she added.

WHO Urges Countries to Act Now to Contain the Spread of Monkeypox Virus

WHO urged countries to take action now to contain the spread of the monkeypox virus.

""We think that if we put in place the right measures now we probably can contain this easily,"" Briand said. Measures needed against the disease include early detection, isolation of cases, and contact tracing.

Brian noted that member states should also share information about first-generation stockpiles of smallpox vaccines which can also be effective against the monkeypox.

WHO then advised countries to take targeted vaccination for close contact with people infected instead of mass vaccinations.

Health officials in Mexico confirmed Saturday the country’s first known case of monkeypox, in a 50-year-old US resident being treated in Mexico City.

The man, a permanent resident of New York City, “was probably infected in the Netherlands,” Hugo Lopez-Gatell, an undersecretary of health, said on Twitter.

“Fortunately, he is stable and in preventive isolation,” Lopez-Gatell said. “We hope he will recover without complications.”

He provided no information on the patient’s possible contacts with other people.

On Friday, health authorities in Argentina confirmed the first two known cases of the disease anywhere in Latin America — those of a 40-year-old man who had returned to Argentina from Spain, and of a Spaniard who was visiting Buenos Aires.

The two cases apparently were unconnected.

The monkeypox virus can be transmitted to humans by infected animals. Person-to-person transmission is possible but rare.

Monkeypox is related to smallpox but is much less severe. Initial symptoms include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a chickenpox-like rash.

There is no specific treatment but vaccination against smallpox has been found to be about 85 percent effective in preventing monkeypox.

Monkeypox was first detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970 and is considered endemic in around a dozen African countries.

Its appearance in non-endemic countries has worried experts, although those cases reported so far have been mostly mild and there have been no deaths.

There have been at least a half-dozen confirmed or suspected cases in the US."

Both patients have arrived from Spain but are not connected

Argentine health authorities Friday confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in the country. Both men had been in Spain recently but are not connected.

One of the patients, who had been reported as a suspected infection last Sunday, is in good condition, undergoing symptomatic treatment, according to a Health Ministry statement. He has been isolated since he showed up at a Buenos Aires clinic for treatment.

His close contacts are under clinical and epidemiological control without presenting symptoms to date, the document went on. The patient had been in Spain between April 28 and May 16.

The Health Ministry confirmed that the result of the PCR amplification reaction of the case is positive and stated that the genomic sequencing under the Sanger method showed a very high percentage of homology with Monkeypox sequences of the West African clade.

A clade is a group of living beings formed by species that share a specific genetic trait inherited from a common ancestor, from which they evolved.

Regarding the second confirmed case, the authorities explained it was a Spanish resident visiting the province of Buenos Aires and who has no link with the first case. The traveler arrived in Argentina last Wednesday, May 25, and started showing symptoms the following day.

The Ministry of Health of the Nation informs that the result of the PCR amplification reaction of the sample taken from the second high probability case is positive, which confirms infection with poxviruses belonging to the African Eurasian group of the genus orthopox, according to the communiqué.

The patient has ulcerative lesions with no other associated symptoms. He is in good general condition, isolated, and receiving symptomatic treatment, it was reported.

His close contacts are under strict clinical and epidemiological follow-up, and all are asymptomatic to date, the statement went on.

Outside the 11 African countries where the disease is endemic, countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Canada, and the United States, among others, have confirmed cases of the disease.

About the outbreaks that are occurring in the world, what mathematical epidemiology says is that they are compatible with a state of reduced immunity of the population because vaccination against human smallpox was stopped in the 80's and, since that vaccine, although it was for another disease, offers protection against monkeypox. It has not been applied for 40 years, and the people who are protected are less and less, that is to say that the herd immunity is broken and the population is susceptible to face a contagion of that disease, National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET) scientist Paula Bergero told Hoy.

The current outbreak would be an effect produced by a superpropagation event, she added.

In previous outbreaks of this disease, it has been seen that it complies with a 20-60 rule. That is, not all people spread the same; some spread much more than others and, therefore, what has been seen for monkeypox is that 20% of the people who have the disease are the ones who generate 60% of the infections, she added. In other words, 20% of the people infect more than half of the cases seen in the following generation.

Bergero also explained that it is not a sexually transmitted disease, but it is a disease transmitted by close contact with an infected person. Unlike COVID-19, it is not a condition that is here to stay, she went on."

Argentina now becomes latest country to confirm cases of monkeypox as part of global outbreak

Argentina reported two cases of the monkeypox virus on Friday in men who had recently arrived from Spain, marking the first time the presence of the virus has been confirmed in Latin America during this latest outbreak.

Argentina’s health ministry first confirmed a man from the province of Buenos Aires who had traveled to Spain has monkeypox. Later in the day, the ministry said in a statement that a suspected case involving a resident of Spain who had arrived in Argentina earlier in the week was also confirmed positive.

Argentina now becomes the latest country to confirm cases of monkeypox as part of a global outbreak that has seen the rare virus sprout up in several countries that are not usually known to have outbreaks.

Authorities have revealed little about the patients but said they are both in good health and are being isolated while receiving treatment for their symptoms.

1st confirmed case of monkeypox:

The first confirmed case involved a man who traveled to Spain from April 28 through May 16 and had symptoms compatible with monkeypox, including lesions and a fever, on Sunday.

All of his close contacts are being monitored and none have presented any symptoms to date, the Health Ministry said.

“The patient is in good general health, isolated and receiving symptomatic treatment,” the Health Ministry added. None of his close contacts have yet to present any symptoms.

Full data on monkeypox cases:

Nearly 200 cases of monkeypox have recently been reported in more than 20 countries not usually known to have outbreaks of the disease, the World Health Organization said on Friday. But that looked to be an undercount.

Spain has emerged as an epicenter of this recent outbreak and health authorities confirmed on Friday there were 98 confirmed cases in the country. The United Kingdom has reported 106 confirmed cases while Portugal said Friday the number of people with monkeypox had increased to 74.

Argentine authorities announced the first case of the monkeypox virus in the South American nation on Friday, after a man had recently travelled to Spain.



Authorities also reported another suspected case of the virus although tests are ongoing. It is the first time the virus has been confirmed on the continent of South America.



A Ministry of Health statement said the sequencing of the virus showed strong similarities to the monkeypox subvariant from West Africa and in keeping with the trend of new monkeypox infections worldwide.



According to the statement, the patient with the confirmed case of the virus was "" in good condition, undergoing symptomatic treatment"" and added that the man's close contacts are under clinical and epidemiological observation but have not presented any symptoms to date.



Authorities said the infected patient had been in Spain from April 28 until May 16.



According to local daily, Infobae the man is 40 years old and a resident from the northern area of Greater Buenos Aires. Four days after returning to Argentina, the man developed a range of symptoms from fever to blisters. He was checked over by medical authorities, before being isolated pending his results which came back positive for monkeypox virus.



On Friday, health authorities also reported another suspected case of the monkeypox virus in a resident of Spain, visiting the province of Buenos Aires - but stressed there was ""no connection with the first case.""



The statement said the suspected person ""has ulcerative lesions without other associated symptoms, arrived in the country on May 25 and symptoms began yesterday, May 26, 2022.""



""The patient is in good condition, isolated, and receiving symptomatic treatment. His close contacts are under strict clinical and epidemiological follow-up, all of them being asymptomatic to date.""

NHS hospitals only have room to treat dozens of monkeypox patients and experts say hospitals could run out of beds soon if the outbreak continues to escalate, MailOnline can reveal.

Current UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) guidance says all confirmed cases who need hospital care must be transferred to high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) units.

Only 15 such beds existed across the UK before Covid struck. Capacity was ramped up during the pandemic, but sources within the health service say it still only stands in the region of 50.

NHS bosses insist the country is equipped to deal with the outbreak through its 'tried and tested plans'. Hospital insiders also say current HCID capacity is less than 50 per cent and many of the patients will be quarantining at home, instead.

Experts today told this website that there is 'always a risk that we can run out of beds', and that it could happen if the 'situation continues to deteriorate'. Scientists also, however, insisted Covid proved the NHS can create special isolation wards in the unlikely event specialist units were overwhelmed.

Fifty-seven Britons have now been sickened with the tropical virus, which is usually only detected in Africa. Health chiefs revealed the new tally today, which is almost triple the toll announced on Friday. But monkeypox is usually a mild self-limiting illness, so not everyone requires medical care.

Boris Johnson today claimed it was important for No10 to 'keep an eye' on the situation as he sought to calm fears after Scotland recorded its first case. The PM also ruled out introducing any Covid-like travel restrictions.

Sixteen countries — including the US, Canada, Australia and Spain — have detected the virus this month. Denmark became latest to confirm an infection, in a man who recently returned from Spain.

Health chiefs are alarmed about the 'unprecedented' cluster of cases, which has disproportionately struck gay and bisexual men.

Despite growing concerns about the world's escalating outbreak, top experts are adamant monkeypox won't spiral out of control like Covid, which forced nations into adopting economically-crippling restrictions.

Boris Johnson today said it was important to 'keep an eye on it', as the Government sought to calm fears over the outbreak. Visiting a school in south east London, the Prime Minister said: 'So far the consequences don't seem to be very serious but it’s important that we keep an eye on it and that’s exactly what the new UKHSA is doing'

Timeline of monkeypox in the UK 1958: Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. 1970: The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. 2003: A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. SEPTEMBER 8, 2018: Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. SEPTEMBER 11, 2018: A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria. They were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Liverpool University Hospital. SEPTEMBER 26, 2018: A third person is diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. DECEMBER 3, 2019: A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. MAY 25, 2021: Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. MAY 7, 2022: A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. MAY 14, 2022: Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. MAY 16, 2022: Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The spate of cases was described as 'unusual' and 'surprising' as experts warn gay and bisexual men to look out for new rashes. MAY 19, 2022: Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. MAY 20, 2022: Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them MAY 23, 2022: Scotland logs its first ever monkeypox case and 36 more infectioned announced in England. It brings the UK total to 57. Advertisement

Only five NHS hospitals in England are currently geared up to treat patients with an airborne HCID, which is what monkeypox is technically labelled as.

These include: The Royal Free Hospital and Guy's and St Thomas' in London, Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, and the Royal Liverpool Hospital.

Dr Nick Price, the director of the UK's airborne HCID network, said there was just 15 HCID beds across the country pre-pandemic.

Capacity was 'squeezed' up to 40 during the Covid crisis, he wrote in a blog post outlining the NHS's early Covid struggles.

Dr Price was the consultant in charge of treating Boris Johnson when the PM caught Covid and needed to be admitted to intensive care.

He said it was a 'relief' when the HCID network was 'overwhelmed', when it was having to deal with fewer than 10 cases a week. In a frank admission, he added: 'There was no longer value in trying to contain it by moving patients to specialist units because we had no beds left.'

It is unclear whether the NHS has retained the extra HCID beds made during the pandemic, as by early March the virus patients were moved to isolated Covid hospital wards rather than specialist departments.

High level isolation units, where HCIDs are treated, are equipped to dealing with the world's deadliest pathogens, including Ebola, bird flu and plague.

Access is restricted to specially-trained medics, who all have to wear protective gowns, masks, visors and gloves before entering.

In some cases, specially-designed ventilation tents are set up around patients so staff can treat and feed the sick without physically touching them.

The UK Health Security Agency guidance, last updated on Saturday, states that confirmed monkeypox infections should be admitted to a HCID unit, if they need medical care.

Patients can't currently be treated in normal wards because of the risk of them spreading their infection to others, sources told MailOnline.

Infected Britons who are battling mild symptoms can safely recover at home, meaning not all of the UK's cases will necessarily occupy a HCID bed.

This website understands national HCID capacity has yet to exceed the 50 per cent threshold, and commentators say the pandemic proved the NHS can easily create isolated wards if numbers were to keep spiralling.

Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert based at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: 'There is always a risk that we can run out of beds.

'It depends on how many cases need that level of managed facilities.

'If people are willing to stay at home, that's probably the safest place for them. Most adults do not get very unwell with it so can manage their illness at home.

'The concern is that in the 2018 outbreak, the case infected a health worker and that was thought to be while they were changing the bedding because the flakes from their scabs were spread.

'Patients have to be kept in the specialist unit to avoid the spread.'

Dr Simon Clarke, an infectious disease expert based at the University of Reading, said: 'If there were a problem with numbers, there is no reason why a hospital couldn’t create a ""monkeypox ward"".'

He also warned it was possible this could happen if the 'situation continues to deteriorate'.

However, he added: 'I don't think anyone really has a good idea of how prevalent this currently is in the UK.

'It could be a mistake to use all the HCID beds for monkeypox, as some will need to be kept available for other things.'

An NHS spokesperson said: 'The NHS has tried and tested plans in place for treating sporadic cases of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, through a network of highly specialised centres providing expert care.

'The NHS is working closely with UKHSA to ensure the small number of people identified are treated in line with their guidance.'

Downing Street said the UKHSA is monitoring monkeypox 'extremely carefully'. The Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'The facts we know is monkeypox is not usually spread easily between people, and the risk to others remains low.

The Government urged high risk contacts of monkeypox in the UK to self-isolate for three weeks as cases rise across Britain

WHAT IS A HIGH LEVEL ISOLATION UNIT? High level isolation units (HLIU) are used to treat patients with high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) such as Ebola, plague and monkeypox. Access is restricted to specially-trained medics, who have to wear protective gowns, face masks, visors and gloves before entering. In some cases, specially-designed tents are set up around patients so staff can treat and feed the sick without physically touching them. HLIUs have specialist facilities, such as a specific entrance for the patient, autoclaves which decontaminate waste and a dedicated laboratory for carrying out tests. All the air leaving the unit is cleaned so there is no risk to anyone else at the hospital. Advertisement

'A notable portion of early cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men, so the UKHSA is urging this community in particular to be alert. It's true to say most people recover within a few weeks.'

Asked if the Prime Minister has spoken to chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty over the matter, the spokesman said: 'I don't believe he has.' But they added: 'He's receiving regular updates on it.'

Downing Street said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the COBRA emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans.

Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries, the PM's official spokesman said: 'No, no considerations of that kind. What we’re seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel.'

He said vaccines are being offered to close contacts but no plans for an 'at scale' vaccination drive. 'We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers but given the nature of this and how we know it’s spreading, it’s thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign,' he said.

Meanwhile, Mr Johnson himself said monkeypox was a rare disease but it was important to 'keep an eye on it'.

He told reporters on a visit to a school in south east London: 'It's basically very rare disease.

'And so far the consequences don't seem to be very serious but it's important we keep an eye on it and that is exactly what the the new UK Health Security Agency is doing.'

Asked whether there should be quarantine for visitors or the use of the smallpox vaccine, Mr Johnson said: 'As things stand the judgment is that it's rare.

Conspiracy theories swirl in China that monkeypox was deliberately leaked by the UNITED STATES Chinese social media users are saying the US could be the source of the rise in monkeypox cases, which have now spread to at least a dozen countries. A hashtag on the US reporting two cases of monkeypox has attracted more than 51 million views on Weibo as of Monday. The infectious disease became a tending topic on the platform after cases were found in the UK, Spain and Australia. Chinese state media has accused the United States of intentionally spreading Covid-19, which originated in China, but has so far held back from taking the same approach with monkeypox. The social media speculation is centered around a 2021 report on biosecurity preparedness planning by a US non-government organisation, known as the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). The report describes a hypothetical scenario for an outbreak of monkeypox which has been taken out of context by Chinese social media users to suggest the US knew of the pandemic beforehand.

'I think we are looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. It hasn't yet proved, fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.'

It comes after experts today warned a return to travel restrictions, previously brought in to limit the spread of new Covid variants, could be on the horizon.

Professor Kathy Bergin, an expert on the workings of the WHO at Cornell Law School, claimed if the UN agency declares monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), countries will almost certainly bring in travel restrictions.

But she said it is unclear is this will happen. Only six PHEIC's have ever been declared before, with Covid being the most recent.

The classification is based on the seriousness of a disease and whether it has spread across international borders. If it does go ahead, the WHO 'will almost certainly caution against travel restrictions'.

Professor Bergin added: 'However, travel restrictions have been the go-to response for many countries once an international emergency is declared, and the WHO doesn’t have a mechanism to force countries to comply with its recommendations beyond diplomacy or ""naming and shaming"".'

High-risk close contacts of monkeypox sufferers, including NHS workers, are being told to self-isolate for three weeks and to avoid contact with children.

That is twice as long as the quarantine advice for Covid contacts at the height of the pandemic because the virus' incubation period is much longer.

The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are now considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group.

Britons are being warned to 'be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns'.

MailOnline last week revealed UK health chiefs were also attempting to contain the spread by vaccinating close contacts of monkeypox cases, including NHS workers, with the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.

Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018. The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a virus which is similar to smallpox and monkeypox but does not cause disease in people.

The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of the disease. EU health chiefs today called on member states to adopt a similar plan.

As part of its strategy, sources say the UK has already ordered an extra 20,000 vaccines. The UKHSA has not yet disclosed exactly how many close contacts have already been vaccinated.

Experts also told MailOnline last week it was possible gay men could be offered monkeypox vaccines as part of a focused roll-out, if cases continue to disproportionally be in homosexual and bisexual males.

Monkeypox cases are usually only found in West Africa, and the virus does not often spread elsewhere. That is why outbreaks reported across Europe, Canada, Australia and the US have caused alarm among public health experts.

The disease, first discovered in lab monkeys in the late 1950s, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. It can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit.

Monkeypox has an incubation period of anywhere up to 21 days, meaning it can take three weeks for symptoms to appear.

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body — including the genitals. The rash can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off.

It comes as a senior World Health Organization official today insisted it does not have evidence the monkeypox virus has mutated to spread easier.

Rosamund Lewis, head of the smallpox secretariat — a part of the WHO Emergencies Programme, said the virus does not mutate as quickly as others.

Meanwhile, the WHO's emerging diseases and zoonoses lead described the situation as 'containable'.

Maria Van Kerkhove told a briefing: 'We want to stop human-to-human transmission. We can do this in the non-endemic countries... This is a containable situation.'

Denmark today became the latest country to confirm an infection, in a man who recently returned from Spain.

'Health authorities do not expect widespread infection in Denmark, but we are following the situation closely to be prepared for a possible development in the infection situation,' Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said in a statement.

The man is currently in isolation and authorities are in touch with any close contacts, the ministry said.

Argentina last night also revealed it was probing a possible case.

Health chiefs there said individual with monkeypox symptoms lives in Buenos Aires and was in isolation while tests were being carried out.

They had recently returned from Spain, which has seen 30 cases of the tropical virus, with most having links to single 'sauna' in Madrid.

The Gran Canarian pride festival, held between May 5 and 15 and attended by 80,000 people from Britain and across Europe, is also being investigated after being linked to numerous monkeypox cases in Madrid, Italy and Tenerife.

In Belgium, three cases have been linked with a large-scale fetish festival in Antwerp, which ran from May 5-8.

How DO you catch monkeypox and what are the symptoms? EVERYTHING you need to know about tropical virus

How do you catch monkeypox?

Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually caught from infected animals in west and central Africa.

The tropical virus is thought to be spread by rodents, including rats, mice and even squirrels.

Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, or touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs.

Consuming contaminated wild game or bush meat can also spread the virus.

The orthopoxvirus can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth.

Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people.

However, health chiefs insist it is very rare.

Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs.

The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.

In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now.

How deadly is it?

Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.

Yet, the disease kills up to 10 per cent of cases. But this high rate is thought to be in part due to a historic lack of testing meaning that a tenth of known cases have died rather than a tenth of all infections.

However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit.

The UK cases all had the West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain.

It is thought that cases in Portugal and Spain also have the milder version, though tests are underway.

How is it tested for?

It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox.

Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab - the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.

The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.

What are the symptoms?

It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms.

Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses.

But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet.

The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

How long is someone contagious?

An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath.

The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.

The infectious period is thought to last for three weeks but may vary between individuals.

What do I do if I have symptoms?

Anyone with an unusual rash or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should contact NHS 111 or call a sexual health service.

Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid close contact with others until they have been seen by a medic.

Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.

What even is monkeypox?

Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958.

The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then.

Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.

The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022.

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo)

Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above)

Is it related to chickenpox?

Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox.

The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.

For comparison, monkeypox — like smallpox — is an orthopoxvirus. Because of this link, smallpox vaccines also provide protection against monkeypox.

Are young people more vulnerable?

Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization.

This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971.

The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.

Does it spread as easily as Covid?

Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak.

A World Health Organization report last year suggested the natural R rate of the virus – the number of people each patient would infect if they lived normally while sick – is two.

This is lower than the original Wuhan variant of Covid and about a third of the R rate of the Indian 'Delta' strain.

But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them.

Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.

How is the UK managing the outbreak?

MailOnline this week revealed close contacts of monkeypox cases, including NHS workers, are already being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.

The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease.

A spokesman for the UKHSA did not disclose how many have been vaccinated, but said: 'Those who have required the vaccine have been offered it.'

Health chiefs are also contacting all close contacts of those who have been infected.

Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women.

The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.

As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact.

This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues.

The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group.

What if it continues to spread?

Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'.

Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar.

A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise.

Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups.

He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.

What other countries have spotted cases?

At least 16 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have now detected cases of monkeypox.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been informed of 92 confirmed cases by Saturday and 28 suspected infections, most of which have been detected in Europe.

The most cases have been detected in Spain, Portugal, Canada and the UK.

Within Europe, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland have also confirmed cases.

Australia, Israel and the Canary Islands also have monkeypox patients, while health chiefs in Argentina are investigating a possible case.

The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses causing the illnesses are related

Is there a vaccine for it?

The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related.

Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.

The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.

Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection.

Are there any drugs to treat it?

There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January

There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox.

This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January.

Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.

An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.

What is the situation with the UK outbreak?

Twenty cases were confirmed in the UK between May 6 and 20.

No details about the eleven confirmed on May 20 have been released yet.

But six of the previous nine confirmed cases were in men who have sex with men — which officials say is 'highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks'.

How worrying is it?

UK health chiefs say the risk of a major outbreak is low.

But experts not that the outbreak is 'concerning' and that it is 'very unusual' to see community transmission in Europe.

Dr Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton, said the rise in cases is 'undoubtedly worrying'.

But he noted that 'a big monkeypox outbreak like this is still a very different situation to a Covid pandemic'.

Dr Head added: 'Given 11 further cases have been announced today, it's likely there will be more cases to come in the UK.

'There certainly will be further cases confirmed in other countries. The contact tracing efforts by public health teams will be crucial in containing the outbreak.'

Dr Charlotte Hammer, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Cambridge, said: 'It is very unusual to see community transmission in Europe, previous monkeypox cases have been in returning travellers with limited ongoing spread.

'Based on the number of cases that were already discovered across Europe and the UK in the previous days, it is not unexpected that additional cases are now being and will be found, especially with the contact tracing that is now happening.'

What is the situation in the US?

The US has confirmed two cases and is investigating more.

A Massachusetts man on May 18 became the first confirmed US case for this outbreak.

On May 19, officials in New York City announced they were probing a suspected monkeypox case as well.

And what about Australia?

Australia last week confirmed its first every monkeypox infections.

One is a man in his thirties who travelled from Britain to Melbourne with symptoms earlier this week.

The second case is a man in his forties who became mildly unwell days after returning to New South Wales from Europe. Both he and the person he lives with are isolating at home.

What do I do if I have symptoms?

Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit.

Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially."

Today during a media question-and-answer session, World Health Organization (WHO) Emerging Diseases and Zoonoses Lead Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, said the WHO was aware of around 200 confirmed or suspected cases in Europe, North America, and Australia.

Though anyone can contract monkeypox through close, personal contact, men who have sex with men have been the primary case-patients identified in these outbreaks. Andy Seale, MPH, WHO strategies adviser for the Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis, and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said it was important to remember, however, that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.

""This is not a gay disease,"" said Seale. ""Anybody can contract the virus through close contact. It is not a virus caused by sexual intercourse, but [intercourse] contact is sufficient for transmission.""

CDC: Be on lookout for genital rash

During a media briefing at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today, John Brooks, MD, a medical epidemiologist with the division of HIV/AIDS prevention, said many patients are presenting with the distinctive monkeypox rash around their genitals.

Brooks said clinicians, especially in sexual health clinics, should question patients who have new rashes about travel and sexual history.

""We want people to be thinking about monkeypox; this is something to pay attention to,"" Brooks said. He also said the CDC is working on updating its image archives for clinicians to streamline diagnosis.

Currently there is 1 confirmed monkeypox case in the United States (in Massachusetts), with 4 more probable cases: 2 in Salt Lake City, and 1 each in New York City and Broward County, Florida.

The Salt Lake City Tribune reports that the two suspected cases in that city share a household, where they are currently in isolation. The paper also said the people had recently traveled to a country experiencing monkeypox cases.

UK reports 36 new cases

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in the United Kingdom, according to a press release today. Fifty-six cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the country since May 7.

""While the current outbreak is significant and concerning, the risk to the UK population remains low,"" UKHSA said. ""UKHSA health protection teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and are advising those who have been risk assessed and remain well to isolate at home for up to 21 days.""

Denmark, Scotland, and Israel all reported their first monkeypox cases over the weekend. And a case in Argentina means the outbreak has now traveled to South America.



In a rapid risk assessment today from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the agency said that, since May 15, 67 cases of monkeypox acquired in the European Union have been reported in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.

""The currently diagnosed human monkeypox cases are primarily among men who have sex with men, which suggests that transmission may take place during intimate relations,"" the ECDC said.

""Transmission may occur through close contact of mucosa or non-intact skin with infectious material from the lesions, or through large respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact."""

Boris Johnson today said No10 is watching the monkeypox outbreak closely, as Scotland confirmed its first case of the tropical virus which is sweeping the world.

The Government has sought to calm fears over the situation. MailOnline understands even more cases are set to be announced later today.

Visiting a school in south east London, the Prime Minister added: 'So far the consequences don't seem to be very serious but it's important that we keep an eye on it and that's exactly what the new UKHSA is doing.'

Meanwhile, Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said he is 'cautious' but 'certainly not concerned' about the UK's ability to manage the outbreak. Twenty Britons had been sickened with the virus before today. Scotland's patient is believed to be number 21.

Mr Clarke said: 'We are certainly not in a position where I would in anyway worry the public that this is some repeat of Covid, because it certainly does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.'

Authorities in Scotland are trying to trace anyone who could have been infected by the first case logged north of the border. No details about the patient were released.

Experts are alarmed about the cluster of cases, which has disproportionately struck gay and bisexual men. Health chiefs have already warned the worst is yet to come.

Leading experts are adamant monkeypox won't spiral out of control like the coronavirus, which forced the nation into two years of on/off economically-crippling restrictions. However, they have called the situation 'undoubtedly worrying' and 'unprecedented'.

High-risk close contacts of monkeypox sufferers are being told to self-isolate for three weeks and to avoid contact with children.

That is twice as long as the quarantine advice for Covid contacts at the height of the pandemic because the virus' incubation period is much longer.

Monkeypox is usually only spotted within Africa, but at least 16 countries including the US, France and Spain have all detected the virus this month. Denmark today became the latest country to confirm an infection, in a man who recently returned from Spain.

Boris Johnson today said it was important to 'keep an eye on it', as the Government sought to calm fears over the outbreak.

Timeline of monkeypox in the UK 1958: Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. 1970: The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then. 2003: A Monkeypox outbreak occurred in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet and all patients recovered. SEPTEMBER 8, 2018: Monkeypox appeared in the UK for the first time in a Nigerian naval officer who was visiting Cornwall for training. They were treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. SEPTEMBER 11, 2018: A second UK monkeypox case is confirmed in Blackpool. There is no link with the first case in Cornwall. Instead, the patient is though to have picked up the infection when travelling in Nigeria. They were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Liverpool University Hospital. SEPTEMBER 26, 2018: A third person is diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual worked at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and treated the second Monkeypox case. They received treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. DECEMBER 3, 2019: A patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, marking the fourth ever case. May 25, 2021: Two cases of monkeypox were identified in north Wales. Both patients had travel links to Nigeria. A third person living with one of the cases was diagnosed and admitted to hospital, bringing the total number ever to seven. MAY 7, 2022: A person was diagnosed with Monkeypox in England after recently travelling to Nigeria. The person received care at the expert infectious disease unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. MAY 14, 2022: Two more cases were confirmed in London. The infected pair lived in the same household but had not been in contact with the case announced one week earlier. One of these individuals received care at the expert infectious disease unit at St Mary's Hospital in London. The other isolated at home and did not need hospital treatment. MAY 16, 2022: Four more cases were announced, bringing the UK total to seven. Three of these cases are in London, while one of their contacts is infected in the north east of England. The spate of cases was described as 'unusual' and 'surprising' as experts warn gay and bisexual men to look out for new rashes. MAY 19, 2022: Two more cases were revealed, with no travel links or connections to other cases. The cases were based in the South East and London. Fears began to grow that infections are going undetected. MAY 20, 2022: Eleven more cases are announced, meaning Britain's monkeypox outbreak have doubled to 20. Minsters discuss the possibility of a public health campaign to warn gay men the disease may be more prevalent for them. Advertisement

World Health Organization (WHO) bosses had been informed of 92 confirmed cases by Saturday and 28 suspected infections, most of which have been detected in Europe.

But the true toll will be many times higher, with top scientists warning community transmission means some of the spread is inevitably going undetected.

Scotland's patient is 'being managed and treated in line with nationally agreed protocols and guidance', according to Dr Nick Phin, the medical and public health science director at Public Health Scotland.

The agency did not confirm details of the person being treated in Scotland, or where they were located. But it said close contacts were being traced.

Dr Phin said: 'We have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with such cases of infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.'

It came as Mr Johnson said monkeypox was a rare disease following the spate of cases.

Asked whether there should be quarantine for visitors or the use of the smallpox vaccine, Mr Johnson said: 'As things stand the judgment is that it's rare.

'I think we're looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission.

'It hasn't yet proved, fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.'

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Clarke said: 'As with any new disease, and obviously after the Covid pandemic doubly so, we continue to monitor this very closely.

'I would say I am cautious but I am certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation.

'There is a vaccine which is available and works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it is spread by physical contact.

'That being the case, the risk of community transmission is much lower, we have a working vaccine, if people present with symptoms or have very close contact, then we are advising that they quarantine for three weeks.

'But the threshold for that is quite high — it really does have to be close physical or sexual contact.'

Downing Street has said the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is monitoring monkeypox 'extremely carefully'.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'The facts we know is that monkeypox is not usually spread easily between people, and the risk to others remains low.

'A notable portion of early cases detected have been in gay and bisexual men, so the UKHSA is urging this community in particular to be alert.

'It's true to say that most people recover within a few weeks.'

Asked if the Prime Minister has spoken to chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty over the matter, the spokesman said: 'I don't believe he has.

'He's receiving regular updates on it and the Health Secretary is leading for the Cabinet.'

It comes as it emerged last night that high-risk close contacts of monkeypox patients are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact with under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women.

The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.

The three-week isolation is twice as long as the advice for contacts of those with Covid at the height of the pandemic because the incubation period is much longer.

People are considered a lower-risk contact if they have come within one metre of a monkeypox contact.

These individuals, who include those who have sat next to an infected person on a plane, are receiving daily phone calls from contact tracer and advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues.

The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group.

Britons are being warned to 'be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns'.

MailOnline last week revealed UK health chiefs were also attempting to contain the spread by vaccinating close contacts of monkeypox cases, including NHS workers, with the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.

Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury, this morning said he is 'cautious' but 'certainly not concerned' about the UK's ability to manage the outbreak, which had been detected in 20 Britons by Friday

The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease.

A spokesman for the UKHSA did not disclose how many have been vaccinated, but said: 'Those who have required the vaccine have been offered it.'

The UK already had 5,000 doses but have now ordered an extra 20,000, sources say.

Experts also told this website how it was possible gay men could be offered monkeypox vaccines as part of a focused roll-out, if cases continue to disproportionally be in homosexual and bisexual males.

Belgium reportedly became the first country to bring in a compulsory three-week quarantine for monkeypox patients.

Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: 'We need to take urgent action to make sure the current monkeypox outbreak burns out, including tracing the contacts of people who are infected and offering them a smallpox vaccination, which we are doing in the UK.

'We will need to see how it goes in the UK in terms of whether it is necessary to have mandatory three-week quarantine periods.

'But I can't see many of these people wanting to go out when they are feeling ill with horrible pustules on their body.'

Monkeypox cases are usually found in West Africa, and the virus does not often spread elsewhere.

That is why outbreaks reported across Europe, Canada, Australia and the US have caused alarm among public health experts.

The disease, first discovered in lab monkeys in the late 1950s, is usually mild but can cause severe illness in some cases. It can kill up to 10 per cent of people it infects. The milder strain causing the current outbreak kills one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit.

Monkeypox has an incubation period of anywhere up to 21 days, meaning it can take three weeks for symptoms to appear.

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body — including the genitals. The rash can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off.

Argentina last night became the latest nation to announce a suspected case of monkeypox. If confirmed, it will be the sixteenth in the world and first in South America.

A health official said individual with monkeypox symptoms lives in Buenos Aires and was in isolation while tests were being carried out.

They had recently returned from Spain, which has seen 30 cases of the tropical virus, with most having links to single 'sauna' in Madrid.

The Government urged high risk contacts of monkeypox in the UK to self-isolate for three weeks as cases rise across Britain

Monkeypox threat doesn't rise to level of Covid, Joe Biden says The monkeypox outbreak does not pose the same risk as Covid, US president Joe Biden said. Speaking in Tokyo just one day after warning the virus was something 'to be concerned about', Mr Biden said: 'I just don't think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with Covid.' Monkeypox is rarely identified outside of Africa. But as of Friday, there were 80 confirmed cases worldwide, including at least two in the US. A possible third US infection was being probed in Broward County in South Florida, which state health officials said appeared to be related to international travel. Although the disease belongs to the same virus family as smallpox, its symptoms are milder. People usually recover within two to four weeks without needing to be hospitalized, but the disease occasionally is deadly. Asked whether the US has enough stockpile of the smallpox vaccine, which works against monkeypox, Mr Biden said, 'I think we do have enough to deal with the likelihood of a problem.' Advertisement

The Gran Canarian pride festival, held between May 5 and 15 and attended by 80,000 people from Britain and across Europe, is also being investigated after being linked to numerous monkeypox cases in Madrid, Italy and Tenerife.

In Belgium, three cases have been linked with a large-scale fetish festival in Antwerp, which ran from May 5 to May 8.

Organisers said there is 'reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries'.

There were 20 cases of monkeypox in the UK as of Friday, but Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency's chief medical adviser, said officials were detecting more cases 'on a daily basis'.

The first patient had returned from Nigeria, where the smallpox-like virus is endemic. None of the other cases are related to travel, suggesting there is community transmission.

One of the cases is reportedly a young child who is intensive care in a London hospital, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

There had previously been only seven cases in the UK since 2018, all related to travel from Africa.

Dr Hopkins told the BBC: 'We don't know where this infection has come from and how it's come in to Europe. There is no obvious connection in our cases in the UK to a single event.'

A large proportion of cases in the UK are being found in gay and bisexual men.

Asked why it is being found in that demographic, Dr Hopkins said: 'Because of the frequent close contacts they may have.

'We would recommend to anyone who's having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash.'

Those believed to be at high risk of developing symptoms are being offered a smallpox vaccine, which can provide protection from monkeypox, with health officials aiming to give it to contacts of patients within four or five days of the patients developing symptoms.

Dr Hopkins said the risk to the general population 'remains extremely low at the moment', but people 'need to be alert to it'.

When asked about the risk to Britons going to summer festivals and children on sunshine holidays, Dr Hopkins said: 'The risk to the general population [from monkeypox] remains extremely low... People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.'

Dr Hopkins warned anyone who feels ill with any symptoms to 'stay at home' and urged those with a suspicious rash to 'immediately seek medical care, either by calling your GP or a sexual health clinic'.

Meanwhile, US president Joe Biden said he does not think the risk from monkeypox 'rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with Covid'.

The remarks come one day after he said the outbreak was something 'to be concerned about'.

How DO you catch monkeypox and what are the symptoms? EVERYTHING you need to know about tropical virus

Monkeypox is spreading globally for the first time, in an outbreak that has caught health officials off-guard.

The UK's case count on Friday doubled to 20 but the majority of them are not linked — which suggests more are going undetected.

A disproportionate number of cases are in gay and bisexual men, authorities have said. Health chiefs say the pattern of transmission is 'highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks'.

Here is everything we know about the monkeypox outbreak so far:

How do you catch monkeypox?

Until this worldwide outbreak, monkeypox was usually caught from infected animals in west and central Africa.

The tropical virus is thought to be spread by rodents, including rats, mice and even squirrels.

Humans can catch the illness — which comes from the same family as smallpox — if they're bitten by infected animals, or touch their blood, bodily fluids, or scabs.

Consuming contaminated wild game or bush meat can also spread the virus.

The orthopoxvirus can enter the body through broken skin — even if it's not visible, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth.

Despite being mainly spread by wild animals, it was known that monkeypox could be passed on between people.

However, health chiefs insist it is very rare.

Human-to-human spread can occur if someone touches clothing or bedding used by an infected person, or through direct contact with the virus' tell-tale scabs.

The virus can also spread through coughs and sneezes.

In the ongoing surge in cases, experts think the virus is passing through skin-to-skin contact during sex — even though this exact mechanism has never been seen until now.

How deadly is it?

Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment.

Yet, the disease kills up to 10 per cent of cases. But this high rate is thought to be in part due to a historic lack of testing meaning that a tenth of known cases have died rather than a tenth of all infections.

However, with milder strains the fatality rate is closer to one in 100 — similar to when Covid first hit.

The UK cases all had the West African version of the virus, which is mild compared to the Central African strain.

It is thought that cases in Portugal and Spain also have the milder version, though tests are underway.

How is it tested for?

It can be difficult to diagnose monkeypox as it is often confused with other infections such as chickenpox.

Monkeypox is confirmed by a clinical assessment by a health professional and a test in the UK's specialist lab - the UKHSA's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.

The test involves taking samples from skin lesions, such as part of the scab, fluid from the lesions or pieces of dry crusts.

What are the symptoms?

It can take up to three weeks for monkeypox-infected patients to develop any of its tell-tale symptoms.

Early signs of the virus include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion — meaning it could, theoretically, be mistaken for other common illnesses.

But its most unusual feature is a rash that often begins on the face, then spreads to other parts of the body, commonly the hands and feet.

The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

How long is someone contagious?

An individual is contagious from the point their rash appears until all the scabs have fallen off and there is intact skin underneath.

The scabs may also contain infectious virus material.

The infectious period is thought to last for three weeks but may vary between individuals.

What do I do if I have symptoms?

Anyone with an unusual rash or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should contact NHS 111 or call a sexual health service.

Britons are asked to contact clinics ahead of their visit and avoid close contact with others until they have been seen by a medic.

Gay and bisexual men have been asked to be especially alert to the symptoms as most of the cases have been detected in men who have sex with men.

What even is monkeypox?

Monkeypox was first discovered when an outbreak of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research in 1958.

The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the infection has been reported in a number of central and western African countries since then.

Only a handful of cases have been reported outside of Africa and they were confined to people with travel links to the continent.

The UK, US, Israel and Singapore are the only countries which had detected the virus before May 2022.

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to one in ten of those infected but does not spread easily between people. The tropical disease is endemic in parts of Africa and is known for its rare and unusual rashes, bumps and lesions (file photo)

Nurses and doctors are being advised to stay 'alert' to patients who present with a new rash or scabby lesions (like above)

Is it related to chickenpox?

Despite causing a similar rash, chickenpox is not related to monkeypox.

The infection, which usually strikes children, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.

For comparison, monkeypox — like smallpox — is an orthopoxvirus. Because of this link, smallpox vaccines also provide protection against monkeypox.

Are young people more vulnerable?

Britons aged under 50 may be more susceptible to monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization.

This is because children in the UK were routinely offered the smallpox jab, which protects against monkeypox, until 1971.

The WHO also warns that the fatality rate has been higher among young children.

Does it spread as easily as Covid?

Leading experts insist we won't be seeing Covid-style levels of transmission in the monkeypox outbreak.

A World Health Organization report last year suggested the natural R rate of the virus – the number of people each patient would infect if they lived normally while sick – is two.

This is lower than the original Wuhan variant of Covid and about a third of the R rate of the Indian 'Delta' strain.

But the real rate is likely much lower because 'distinctive symptoms greatly aid in its early detection and containment,' the team said, meaning it's easy to spot cases and isolate them.

Covid is mainly spread through droplets an infected person releases whenever they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze.

How is the UK managing the outbreak?

MailOnline this week revealed close contacts of monkeypox cases, including NHS workers, are already being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine.

The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease.

A spokesman for the UKHSA did not disclose how many have been vaccinated, but said: 'Those who have required the vaccine have been offered it.'

Health chiefs are also contacting all close contacts of those who have been infected.

Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact under-12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women.

The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.

As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact.

This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for three weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues.

The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group.

What if it continues to spread?

Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'.

Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The two rash-causing viruses are very similar.

A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise.

Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups.

He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.

What other countries have spotted cases?

At least 16 countries — including the US, Spain and Italy — have now detected cases of monkeypox.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been informed of 92 confirmed cases by Saturday and 28 suspected infections, most of which have been detected in Europe.

The most cases have been detected in Spain, Portugal, Canada and the UK.

Within Europe, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland have also confirmed cases.

Australia, Israel and the Canary Islands also have monkeypox patients, while health chiefs in Argentina are investigating a possible case.

The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses causing the illnesses are related

Is there a vaccine for it?

The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses causing the illnesses are related.

Data shows it prevents around 85 per cent of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.

The jab, thought to cost £20 per dose, contains a modified vaccinia virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.

Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection.

Are thre any drugs?

There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox, including the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January

There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox.

This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January.

Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.

An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.

What is the situation with the UK outbreak?

Twenty cases were confirmed in the UK between May 6 and 20.

No details about the eleven confirmed on May 20 have been released yet.

But six of the previous nine confirmed cases were in men who have sex with men — which officials say is 'highly suggestive of spread in sexual networks'.

How worrying is it?

UK health chiefs say the risk of a major outbreak is low.

But experts not that the outbreak is 'concerning' and that it is 'very unusual' to see community transmission in Europe.

Dr Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton, said the rise in cases is 'undoubtedly worrying'.

But he noted that 'a big monkeypox outbreak like this is still a very different situation to a Covid pandemic'.

Dr Head added: 'Given 11 further cases have been announced today, it's likely there will be more cases to come in the UK.

'There certainly will be further cases confirmed in other countries. The contact tracing efforts by public health teams will be crucial in containing the outbreak.'

Dr Charlotte Hammer, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Cambridge, said: 'It is very unusual to see community transmission in Europe, previous monkeypox cases have been in returning travellers with limited ongoing spread.

'Based on the number of cases that were already discovered across Europe and the UK in the previous days, it is not unexpected that additional cases are now being and will be found, especially with the contact tracing that is now happening.'

What is the situation in the US?

The US has confirmed two cases and is investigating more.

A Massachusetts man on May 18 became the first confirmed US case for this outbreak.

On May 19, officials in New York City announced they were probing a suspected monkeypox case as well.

And what about Australia?

Australia last week confirmed its first every monkeypox infections.

One is a man in his thirties who travelled from Britain to Melbourne with symptoms earlier this week.

The second case is a man in his forties who became mildly unwell days after returning to New South Wales from Europe. Both he and the person he lives with are isolating at home.

What do I do if I have symptoms?

Anyone worried that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit.

Health chiefs say their call or discussion will be treated sensitively and confidentially."

In a statement, the government said that the patient, who is from Buenos Aires Province and returned to the country a week ago from Spain, had symptoms compatible with the rare disease, including “pustules on different parts of the body and fever.”

The unnamed individual, who was in Europe from April 28 to May 16, is in “good general health,” the Health Ministry said.

Monkeypox symptoms include fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face.

The virus, which causes distinctive pustules but is rarely fatal, has previously been seen in central and west Africa. No treatment exists for the rare disease, but the symptoms usually clear up after two to four weeks.

Argentina’s Health Ministry said that samples from the suspected case had been taken for analysis at the ANLIS-Carlos Malbrán state health institute.

A working group with officials from the Buenos Aires City and Province governments has been set up to coordinate clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological responses to the disease and implement measures to control outbreaks and avoid possible transmission, it said in a statement.

As of May 21, the World Health Organisation has received reports of 92 laboratory-confirmed monkeypox cases and 28 suspected cases from 12 countries where the disease is not endemic, including several European nations, the United States, Australia and Canada.

Monkeypox, or “ortopoxvirosis simia,” usually clears up after two to four weeks, according to the WHO, which says it is investigating the fact that many of the initial cases reported in Europe involved people identifying as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.

""It is probably too early to draw conclusions about the mode of transmission or to assume that sexual activity is necessary for transmission,"" Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London's Science Centre (SMC), told the AFP new agency.

Argentina’s Health Ministry said Monday that ""transmission between sexual partners, due to intimate contact during sexual intercourse with infectious skin lesions, appears to be the likely mode of transmission.”

Long a disease seen mostly in parts of tropical Africa, it has now made appearances in the U.S. continental Europe, Canada, and the U.K., all at approximately the same time.

According to the Associated Press:

LONDON (AP) — As more cases of monkeypox are detected in Europe and North America, some scientists who have monitored numerous outbreaks in Africa say they are baffled by the unusual disease's spread in the West. Cases of the smallpox-related disease haven’t previously been seen among people with no links to central and West Africa. But in the past week, Britain, Spain, Portugal, Italy, U.S., Sweden and Canada all reported infections, mostly in young men who hadn’t previously traveled to Africa. France, Germany, Belgium and Australia confirmed their first cases of monkeypox on Friday. “I’m stunned by this. Every day I wake up and there are more countries infected,” said Oyewale Tomori, a virologist who formerly headed the Nigerian Academy of Science and who sits on several World Health Organization advisory boards. “This is not the kind of spread we’ve seen in West Africa, so there may be something new happening in the West,” he said.

Viruses and bacterias, of course, can mutate, which could explain the sudden rate of the spread.

But the unasked question in all of the stories cited is how the disease got here to start with.

Sure, it may have been some Armani-suited oil executive from some place like London bringing it in after accidentally touching a rail or dirty napkin at the hotel while on a business trip to Lagos.

But it seems just as plausible that it may have been the byproduct of mass immigration from unvetted illegals who are rolling into the U.S. by the hundreds of thousands -- from 157 countries, with tropical Africa prominent among them. Europe, too, has allowed its borders to go effectively open, accepting everyone as either a ""refugee"" or ""asylum seeker"" and that includes post-Brexit U.K. Surprise, surprise -- they too have somehow found themselves with monkeypox.

Unlike immigrants and travelers who come to the U.S. legally, who must present proof of shots, vaccinations, and sound health to U.S. Customs officials, illegal immigrants are another story. Joe Biden has released hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated, un-health-checked illegal migrants into the interior of the country, to all points, under cover of darkness to prevent unwelcome news coverage.

According to the Daily Caller:

As border encounters broke historic levels in April, over 117,000 migrants were allowed to stay in the country, according to a court filing. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported the release of 117,989 out of the 234,088 migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border in April, according to the filing. Meanwhile, DHS expelled 113,248 migrants under Title 42 or Title 8, for inadmissibility, in April. The number of migrants authorities encountered is the highest since DHS began recording southwest border encounters. Title 42, the Trump-era policy used to quickly expel certain migrants to Mexico, is set to end May 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced April 1. However, a federal judge indicated Friday he would make a decision on whether to grant a pause in a Republican attorneys general lawsuit against Biden before the planned end date, according to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich.

Every last one of them up to date on their vaxxes and screened for communicable diseases? Don't bet on it.

This is hardly proof that illegal migrants are bringing in monkeypox with them, but to refuse to ask that question at this point, effectively ruling that out, is junk science. The odds are more than even that an unvetted migrant may be a carrier of an infectious disease, given the lack of screening.

Now Joe Biden is planning to lift Title 42 on expelling migrants due to pandemic risks, which had kept a certain number of migrants out but certainly not all of them, including migrants who spread disease. What could go wrong?

POV: La Casa de Mama Icha

Monday, October 18 at 10 pm

American Documentary | POV is pleased to announce the national broadcast premiere of La Casa de Mama Icha, the debut feature documentary from Colombian director and cinematographer Óscar Molina. Debuting as part of POV’s 34th season, the documentary will premiere Monday, October 18, 2021 on PBS at 10 p.m. ET and at pov.org. It will also be available to stream for free at pov.org through December 17, 2021. La Casa de Mama Icha is a co-presentation of POV and Latino Public Broadcasting.

An honorable mention at the Philadelphia Latino Film Festival and an official selection at the Cartagena International Film Festival, La Casa de Mama Icha offers a profound meditation on notions of home and the inescapable pull of one’s motherland. The documentary follows María Dionisia Navarro, otherwise known as Mama Icha, on a physical and spiritual journey that draws on the complexities inherent to many migrant experiences: distance, the loved ones left behind, and the problem of aging in a country that doesn’t feel like your own.

At ninety-three, Mama Icha feels that the end of her life is near. Despite protestations from her family, she spends her days focusing on just one thing: returning to her native village of Mompox in northern Colombia. Mama Icha dreams of passing her final years taking comfort in the landscapes of her youth, walking along the Magdalena River at dusk, surrounded by her relatives and neighbors in the courtyard of the house that she painstakingly had built during her years of absence, with the money she sent from abroad.

Thirty years prior, Mama Icha had emigrated to the United States to help her daughter with the care of her children, Mama Icha’s grandchildren, and remained ever since. Now, against the best wishes of her family in the U.S. who feel that she’s built an admirable life in Philadelphia complete with Social Security, a community that supports her, and access to important senior resources, ​​Mama Icha boards a plane and flies back to Colombia where she meets her sons, Gustavo and Alberto, who have been in charge of her house while she’s been gone.

But upon returning, the idyllic world of her memories is put up against a harsh reality of deteriorating family relationships and broken expectations. The confrontation is disappointing and forces Mama Icha to consider exactly how much she’s willing to sacrifice for the notion of home that she’s longed for so long.

“La Casa de Mama Icha is a declaration of love to one’s own land,” said director Óscar Molina. “In a time of great displacements, of fragmentation of the bonds of belongingness, of the preponderance of certain hegemonic cultural values, Mama Icha’s story reinforces the relevance of a sense of rootedness. She, heroically and with the strength of ancestral thought, faces great obstacles to meet the goal of living her last days and dying in the land of her origin.La casa de Mama Icha also mirrors family conflicts and how difficult they are, especially when elders start depending on the care of others. Altogether, this story invites us to think about the multiple meanings of the experience of ‘home’.”

“This is a story of a woman’s dignity and unwillingness to negotiate her values and fulfill her last wish even if she has to leave a comfortable life behind. Mama Icha embodies the dream of many migrants who long to return home. As for many migrants, home is a complex experience and also the point of departure for most of the other experiences that shape our identity. Mama Icha is returning to a house built from a distance and with remittances sent back to Colombia from the United States due to the financial dependency of the income obtained in their host countries. Her story is also of a woman who, even in old age, plans to repair the family fabric that was damaged during her absence. Our invitation to viewers is always to see in Mama Icha’s story a mirror for our own relationships: towards ourselves, our families and our places of origin,” said producer Brenda Steinecke Soto.

“In the lines of Mama Icha’s face we see the contours of a lifetime. A life of joy but also struggle, laid bare by the distance between the places she calls home and the efforts it takes to remain rooted in culture and family. This is a beautiful and loving family portrait that will touch any viewer. Don’t miss it!” said Chris White, Executive Producer of POV.

Shot with intimacy and proximity to its subjects, La Casa de Mama Icha is an observational documentary that portrays the heroic return of María Dionisia Navarro to Colombia after three long decades abroad. It is also an important reconfiguration of the standard immigrant narrative, reversing the direction and chronicling the cross-generational pain that often comes with years of family separation. At the same time, the documentary records the injustices that many elderly people face once they come to depend on others for their own care.

But perhaps more than anything, La Casa de Mama Icha points to the fact that sometimes the idea of “home” is more of a process of homecoming than the return to any one physical place. In this way, Mama Icha’s house becomes a symbol for her ultimate desire, to spend her final years with the knowledge that, in the end, she made her pilgrimage back to her place of origin."
